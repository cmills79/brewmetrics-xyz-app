Current State Assessment
✅ What's Working Well:

Core survey system with 8-question beer evaluation
QR code generation and print templates
Basic Firebase authentication and Firestore integration
AI brewing advice via Vertex AI (Gemini 2.5 Flash)
Basic analytics dashboard with Chart.js
⚠️ Critical Issues to Address:

1. Security Vulnerabilities (HIGH PRIORITY)
Your getAIBrewingAdvice function has no authentication - anyone can call it and rack up Vertex AI costs.

2. Missing Analytics Infrastructure (MEDIUM PRIORITY)
You reference BigQuery and advanced analytics throughout your AI-AGENT.md, but these aren't implemented.

3. Production Readiness (HIGH PRIORITY)
Debug code, console.logs, and development artifacts are scattered throughout.
