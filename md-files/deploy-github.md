# GitHub Pages Deployment (Alternative)

## Quick Setup

1. Go to: <https://github.com/cmills79/brewmetrics-xyz-app/settings/pages>
2. Select "Deploy from a branch"
3. Choose "main" branch and "/public" folder
4. Your app will be at: <https://cmills79.github.io/brewmetrics-xyz-app/>

## Benefits

- Free hosting
- Automatic deployments on push
- Custom domain support
- Works with your existing GitHub repo

## Considerations

- Firebase Functions still work (they're cloud-based)
- Authentication works (Firebase config is client-side)
- No server-side rendering needed
