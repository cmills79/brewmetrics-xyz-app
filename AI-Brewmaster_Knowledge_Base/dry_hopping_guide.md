# Dry Hopping Techniques

## What is Dry Hopping?

Dry hopping is the addition of hops to beer during or after fermentation, without boiling. This technique extracts hop oils and aroma compounds while minimizing bitterness extraction, creating intense hop aroma and flavor.

## Timing Strategies

**During Active Fermentation (Days 2-4):**
- Biotransformation effects, CO2 purging reduces oxidation
- Best for tropical fruit character, NEIPA styles

**Late Fermentation (Days 5-7):**
- Balanced extraction, good aroma retention
- Best for traditional IPAs, balanced hop character

**Post-Fermentation (Cold):**
- Maximum aroma retention, no yeast interaction
- Best for delicate hop varieties, final aroma boost

## Dosage Guidelines

**Light:** 0.5-1 oz per 5 gallons - Subtle aroma enhancement
**Medium:** 1-2 oz per 5 gallons - Standard IPA levels
**Heavy:** 2-4 oz per 5 gallons - NEIPA, Double IPA levels
**Extreme:** 4+ oz per 5 gallons - Specialty/experimental beers

## Best Hop Varieties

**High-Oil Varieties:**
- Citra: Tropical fruit, citrus
- Mosaic: Berry, tropical, floral
- Galaxy: Passion fruit, citrus
- Amarillo: Orange, floral
- Simcoe: Pine, citrus, earthy

## Application Methods

**Loose Hops:** Maximum extraction, difficult removal
**Hop Bags:** Easy removal, reduced efficiency
**Hop Canisters:** Professional results, equipment cost

## Contact Time

**Short (1-3 days):** Bright, fresh character
**Medium (3-5 days):** Balanced extraction, standard
**Long (5+ days):** Maximum extraction, risk of vegetal flavors

## Common Issues

**Grassy Flavors:** Reduce contact time, use fresher hops
**Oxidation:** Purge with CO2, minimize headspace
**Clogged Equipment:** Use hop bags, fine mesh
