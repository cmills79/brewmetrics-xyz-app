# 1. The Six Core lons of Brewing Water

Water is the main event in brewing, making up over 90% of your final product.
While it
 might seem like a simple ingredient, the dissolved minerals within it are powerful tools
 that can define a beer's character.
As professional brewers, mastering water chemistry
 is non-negotiable for achieving consistency and creating award-winning beers.
We can
 boil down the complexity to six primary ions that have the most predictable and
 significant impact: Calcium (Ca2+), Magnesium (Mg2+), Sodium (Na+), Sulfate (SO42-),
 Chloride (CI-), and Bicarbonate (HCO3-).
These ions don't work in a vacuum; their
 interactions and relative concentrations are what allow us to guide the mash chemistry,
 influence yeast health, and ultimately shape the final flavor profile.
Understanding how
 to manipulate these ions is the difference between brewing a good beer and brewing a
 great beer that perfectly matches its intended style.
