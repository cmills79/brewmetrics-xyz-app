This recipe is designed to be a quintessential West Coast IPA, defined by its assertive
 bitterness, dry finish, and vibrant citrus/pine hop character, all driven by a

Dry Hop (Day 3 of Ferm): 2.5 kg Citra (12% AA). 2.5 kg Mosaic (12.5% AA)
Yeast:
White Labs WLP001 (California Ale) or Fermentis SafAle US-05
Process:

1. Begin with RO water. Add brewing salts (primarily Gypsum and a small amount
 of Calcium Chloride and Epsom Salt) to the strike and sparge water to hit the
 target profile.
2. Mash in at 66째C (151째F) for 60 minutes. The high calcium level will help drive the
pH into the optimal 5.2-5.4 range, ensuring excellent enzyme activity.
3. Lauter and sparge to collect wort.
4. Boil for 60 minutes, adding hops as scheduled.
5. Chill to $19^{circ}C$ $(66^{circ}F)$ and pitch yeast.
6. Ferment at $20^{circ}C$ (68째F).
7. Add dry hops as fermentation activity begins to slow.
8. After fermentation is complete, crash cool, condition, and carbonate. The high
sulfate level will accentuate the bitterness from the large hop additions, creating
 a crisp, dry finish that quenches the palate and invites another sip.
