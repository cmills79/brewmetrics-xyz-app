# Chloride (Cl-)

Chloride functions as the sensory counterpart to sulfate, enhancing malt character and mouthfeel.

Flavor Role: Chloride accentuates malt sweetness and complexity, contributing to a fuller, softer, and rounder palate. Its effect is antagonistic to sulfate, and the balance between these two ions is one of the most powerful tools a brewer has for shaping the final flavor profile of a beer.

Target Concentration: Generally kept below 250 ppm, as higher concentrations can taste salty or give the beer a "pasty" texture. It is critical to distinguish chloride (

These must be completely removed via carbon filtration or chemical treatment (e.g., potassium metabisulfite) to prevent the formation of highly undesirable chlorophenol off-flavors, which present as medicinal, plastic, or Band-Aid notes.
