# Sodium (Na+)

Sodium is almost exclusively a flavor-active ion, with no significant role in the biochemical reactions of brewing.

Flavor Role: In moderate concentrations (50–150 ppm), sodium enhances the perception of malt sweetness, body, and palate fullness, creating a rounder flavor profile, particularly when paired with chloride ions. However, when levels exceed 200 ppm, it can impart a harsh, salty, or sour character. A critical negative synergy exists between sodium and sulfate; high concentrations of both can create a very unpleasant, harsh bitterness. Therefore, the more sulfate in the water, the less sodium there should be.

Target Concentration: A typical range is 10–70 ppm, though up to 150 ppm can be used judiciously in certain malty styles. Water from household water softeners should be avoided for brewing, as these systems exchange calcium and magnesium for sodium, resulting in excessively high sodium levels.
