# The Principal Ions of Brewing Water

The biochemical and sensory impact of brewing water is governed by the concentration and relative ratios of six principal ions. These are categorized into three positively charged cations—

Calcium (Ca
2+),
Magnesium (Mg
2+),
and Sodium (Na

+ )—and three negatively charged anions—
+
+ Sulfate (SO

), Chloride (Cl

 ), and Bicarbonate (HCO

​
 ), which is the primary contributor to alkalinity. A thorough understanding of each ion's function is fundamental to mastering water chemistry.

The interplay between these ions is complex. While individual target ranges provide a useful guide, a successful water profile must be viewed as a complete system. Adding a salt like gypsum (CaSO

 ) to increase sulfate for an IPA also adds calcium. If the source water is already high in calcium, this addition could push calcium levels into a range that inhibits yeast's ability to uptake magnesium, potentially leading to a sluggish fermentation. This demonstrates that a sophisticated, systems-based approach is necessary, where adjustments to one ion are considered in the context of their effects on all other ions and their downstream biochemical consequences.
