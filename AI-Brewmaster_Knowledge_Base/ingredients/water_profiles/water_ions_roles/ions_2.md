# 2. The Critical Role of Mash pH in Brewing

One of the most immediate effects of brewing water ions is their influence on the pH of
 the mash.
The mash is where starches from the malt are converted into fermentable
 sugars by enzymes, specifically alpha-amylase and beta-amylase.
These enzymes are
 incredibly sensitive to their environment and work most efficiently within a very narrow
 pH range, typically between 5.2 and 5.6.
If the mash pH is too high, you can extract
 harsh-tasting tannins from the grain husks, leading to an astringent, unpleasant beer.
If
 it's too low, enzyme activity will be stunted, resulting in poor starch conversion, lower
 efficiency, and a wort that is difficult to ferment.
Controlling the mash pH isn't just a
 technical detail: it's fundamental to setting the stage for every subsequent step in the
 brewing process, from wort clarity to final flavor balance.
