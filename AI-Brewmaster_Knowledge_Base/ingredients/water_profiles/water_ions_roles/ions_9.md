# 9. Practical Water Adjustment for Commercial Brewing

To consistently control these six key ions, most commercial breweries start with a blank
 canvas: Reverse Osmosis (RO) water.
RO systems strip nearly all minerals from the
 source water, providing a pure base that can be built up with precision.
Using brewing
 software and a water report, a brewer can calculate the exact amount of brewing salts

needed to hit a specific target profile for any beer style.
The most common salts used
 are Gypsum (CaSO4) to add calcium and sulfate;
Calcium Chloride (CaCl2) to add
 calcium and chloride; Epsom Salt (MgSO4) to add magnesium and sulfate;
and Chalk
 (CaCO3) or Sodium Bicarbonate (NaHCO3) to add bicarbonate for alkalinity.
By
 carefully measuring and adding these salts to the mash water (the "strike water") and
 sparge water, a brewer has complete control over the ionic content, ensuring that
 every batch of a specific brand is identical, regardless of seasonal variations in the
 municipal water supply.
