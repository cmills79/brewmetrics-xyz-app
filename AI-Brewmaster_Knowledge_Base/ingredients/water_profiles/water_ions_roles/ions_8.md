# 8. The Flavor-Enhancing Power of Sodium

Sodium (Na+) is purely a flavor-enhancing ion. Used in moderation, it can accentuate
 malt sweetness and contribute to a fuller, rounder mouthfeel, making the beer feel
 richer on the palate.
It works in synergy with chloride to boost the perception of
 maltiness, which is why it's often found in slightly higher concentrations in water
 profiles for stouts and porters.
However, sodium is a double-edged sword. At higher
 concentrations, especially when combined with high sulfate levels, it can create a
 harsh, metallic, or salty flavor that clashes unpleasantly with hop bitterness.
For most
 beer styles, keeping sodium below 75 ppm is a safe bet.
The notable exception is a
 historical style like Gose, which traditionally includes salt as a key ingredient, pushing
 sodium levels much higher to achieve its characteristic saline tang.
