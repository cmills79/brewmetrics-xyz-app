# 3. Balancing Acidity with Bicarbonate and Calcium

The push and pull between two key ions, Calcium (Ca2+) and Bicarbonate (HCO3-), is
 the primary driver of mash pH.
Bicarbonate is the main source of alkalinity, meaning it
 actively works to raise the mash pH.
This is particularly important when brewing dark
 beers. The dark, roasted malts used in stouts and porters are naturally acidic.
The
 alkalinity from bicarbonate balances this acidity, preventing the mash pH from
 dropping too low and creating a smoother, more rounded final product.
On the other
 side of the equation is Calcium. Calcium reacts with phosphates from the malt to
 create an acid, effectively lowering the mash pH.
This is crucial for brewing pale beers,
 where the malts have very little acidity.
Brewers use calcium salts like Gypsum (CaSO4)
 and Calcium Chloride (CaCl2) to counteract any residual alkalinity in their water and
 drive the pH down into the optimal range for pale malt conversion.
This balance, often

referred to as 'Residual Alkalinity,' is a key metric brewers use to predict and control
 their mash pH for any given beer style.
