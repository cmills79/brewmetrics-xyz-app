# Sulfate (SO42−)

 Sulfate is the key ion for accentuating hop character and creating a dry, crisp finish.

Biochemical and Flavor Role: Sulfate positively affects starch and protein degradation during the mash, which can improve lautering efficiency and trub sedimentation. Its primary contribution, however, is to flavor. Sulfate accentuates hop bitterness, making it sharper, drier, and more crisp. The water of Burton-on-Trent, famous for its high sulfate content, is the historical basis for the assertive hop character of English IPAs. Excessive sulfate levels can lead to an astringent or harsh bitterness, an effect that is amplified when combined with high sodium levels.

Target Concentration: This is highly style-dependent. Soft, delicate lagers may call for as little as 10–50 ppm, while classic IPAs and Pale Ales benefit from levels in the 150–350 ppm range. While historical Burton water profiles can exceed 500 ppm, such high levels are often perceived as overly mineralic or "like drywall" by modern palates.
