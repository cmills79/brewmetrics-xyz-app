# 14. Recipe Formula: Dry Irish Stout

This recipe produces a classic Dry Irish Stout, famous for its light body, roasted
 coffee-like flavor, and creamy head.
The water chemistry, specifically the use of
 bicarbonate to balance the acidity of the roasted malts, is crucial for achieving the
 smooth, non-acrid finish characteristic of the style.

CI-: 60

Malt Bill:
145 kg (70%) Pale Malt (2-Row)
* 42 kg (20%) Flaked Barley
Hops:
21 kg (10%) Roasted Barley
60 min: 1.5 kg East Kent Goldings (5% AA)
Yeast:
* Wyeast 1084 (Irish Ale) or Fermentis SafAle S-04
Process:

1. Start with a blend of RO water and tap water, or build from pure RO water.
The
 key is the bicarbonate addition. Add Sodium Bicarbonate (NaHCO3) or Calcium
 Carbonate (CaCO3) to the mash water to reach the target of 200 ppm.
This will
 buffer the mash.
2. Mash in at 67°C (152°F) for 60 minutes. The Roasted Barley is extremely acidic;
the high bicarbonate level will counteract this acidity, preventing the mash pH
 from dropping too low and keeping the final beer smooth and free of acrid,
 burnt flavors.
3. The Flaked Barley is unmalted and contributes proteins that give the stout its
classic creamy head and full-bodied impression despite its low finishing gravity.
4. Lauter, sparge, and collect the wort.
5. Boil for 60 minutes, adding the single hop charge for bittering. The hop
character should be restrained, acting only as a balance to the malt.
6. Chill to $20^{circ}C$ $(68^{circ}F)$ and pitch yeast.
7. Ferment at $21^{circ}C$ (70°F).
8. Once fermentation is complete, condition and prepare for serving, often on a

nitrogen gas blend ("beer gas") to enhance the creamy mouthfeel.
The balanced
 water profile ensures that the focus remains entirely on the complex roast
 character.
