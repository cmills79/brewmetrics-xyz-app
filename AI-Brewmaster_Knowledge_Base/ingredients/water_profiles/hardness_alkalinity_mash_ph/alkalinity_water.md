# Alkalinity (Al)

Alkalinity is a measure of water's buffering capacity, or its ability to neutralize acid and resist changes in pH. In brewing water, alkalinity is almost entirely due to the concentration of bicarbonate (

HCO 3âˆ’) ions. High alkalinity water has a strong buffering capacity and requires a significant amount of acid to lower its pH, making it inherently unsuitable for brewing pale beers without treatment.

Residual Alkalinity (RA)
The concept of Residual Alkalinity (RA), developed by German brewing scientist Paul Kohlbach in the 1940s, provides a single value to estimate the net effect of brewing water on mash pH. It elegantly combines the pH-raising effect of alkalinity with the pH-lowering effect of hardness. During the mash, the calcium and magnesium ions react with phosphates (phytins) from the malt to form precipitates, a reaction that releases acid and neutralizes a portion of the water's alkalinity. RA represents the alkalinity that remains after this reaction.

A positive RA indicates that the water's alkalinity is greater than its hardness, resulting in an increase in the mash pH. This is desirable for brewing dark beers, as the higher alkalinity helps to buffer the significant acidity contributed by roasted malts.

A negative RA indicates that the water's hardness is greater than its alkalinity, resulting in a decrease in the mash pH. This is ideal for brewing pale beers, which require an acidic mash environment.

While modern brewing software can predict mash pH with greater accuracy by incorporating the specific grain bill, understanding the principle of RA remains crucial for grasping the fundamental interplay between water ions and malt.
