# Water Hardness

Hardness refers to the concentration of dissolved divalent cations, primarily calcium (Ca
2+
 ) and magnesium (Mg
2+
 ). It is often expressed in terms of an equivalent amount of calcium carbonate ("as

CaCO
3
​
 "), a convention that can cause confusion with alkalinity, which uses the same unit. Hardness is further divided into two types:

Temporary Hardness is associated with bicarbonate and carbonate anions. It is "temporary" because it can be reduced by boiling the water, which causes calcium and bicarbonate to precipitate as solid calcium carbonate (CaCO
3
​
 ).

Permanent Hardness is associated with anions like sulfate and chloride. This hardness is not removed by boiling.
