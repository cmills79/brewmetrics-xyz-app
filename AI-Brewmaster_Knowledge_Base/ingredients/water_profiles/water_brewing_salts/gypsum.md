Description: A mineral salt used to increase the permanent hardness of brewing water, primarily by adding calcium and sulfate ions. It is the key ingredient for replicating the water profiles of historic brewing regions known for hoppy beers, such as Burton-on-Trent.

Ion Contribution per gram per U.S. gallon:

Calcium (Ca

 ): 61.5 ppm

Sulfate (SO

 ): 147.4 ppm

Brewing Usage:

Effect on Beer: Gypsum is primarily used to accentuate hop bitterness, making it sharper, crisper, and more pronounced. The sulfate ions enhance the perception of dryness in the beer's finish. It lowers the pH of the mash more effectively than Calcium Chloride.

Primary Use: Increasing the sulfate-to-chloride ratio to favor hop-forward styles. A ratio of 2:1 or higher will make hop character more prominent.

Recommended Styles: American IPA, West Coast IPA, English IPA, Pale Ales, and any style where a crisp, dry, and assertive hop character is desired.

Caution: Excessive use can lead to a harsh, metallic, or "minerally" bitterness that can be unpleasant. It can also suppress malt character, making it unsuitable for malt-driven styles like Scottish Ales, Brown Ales, or Porters.

Brewing Salt Addition Guidelines:

- **Mash Addition**: 1-2 grams per gallon of mash water to achieve a sulfate level of 100-200 ppm.

- **Kettle Addition**: 0.5-1 gram per gallon of wort to enhance hop bitterness during the boil.

- **Final Water Profile**: Aim for a sulfate concentration of 150-300 ppm, depending on the desired hop intensity and style.
