# Calcium Carbonate (Chalk)

Brewing Salt: Chalk (Calcium Carbonate)
Salt Name: Chalk (Calcium Carbonate)
Chemical Formula: CaCO
3
​

Description: A salt that was historically used to raise mash pH by adding calcium and carbonate. However, it is notoriously difficult to dissolve in brewing water without the injection of carbon dioxide (CO
2
​
 ), making it an impractical and often ineffective choice for modern brewers.

Ion Contribution per gram per U.S. gallon:

Calcium (Ca
2+
 ): 105.8 ppm

Carbonate (CO
3
2−
​
 ): 158.5 ppm (Note: This is its potential contribution if it dissolves)

Brewing Usage:

Effect on Beer: When it dissolves, it adds bicarbonate/carbonate, which raises mash pH, and calcium, which aids in enzyme function and yeast flocculation.

Primary Use: Theoretically, to raise the alkalinity and pH of the mash for dark beers. In practice, it is largely obsolete. Brewers almost universally prefer using Sodium Bicarbonate (Baking Soda) or Pickling Lime (Calcium Hydroxide) for this purpose due to their superior solubility.

Recommended Styles: Historically associated with dark styles like Dublin-style Stouts. Not recommended for modern brewing practices.

Caution: Not recommended for use. Due to its extremely low solubility in typical brewing water, its effect is unpredictable and unreliable. Adding it directly to the mash can sometimes work, but results are inconsistent. Better, more soluble alternatives exist.

Brewing Salt Addition Guidelines:

- **Mash Addition**: Not recommended due to poor solubility. If used, aim for 0.5-1 gram per gallon of mash water, but expect limited effectiveness.

- **Kettle Addition**: Not typically added to the kettle due to solubility issues.

- **Final Water Profile**: Due to its poor solubility, it is not practical to aim for a specific concentration in the final water profile.

- **pH Adjustment**: Not a reliable method for pH adjustment due to its low solubility. Use Baking Soda or Pickling Lime instead.

- **Storage**: Store in a cool, dry place. It is stable but should be kept away from moisture to prevent clumping.

- **Note**: Chalk is largely a historical curiosity in brewing. Modern brewers should avoid it and use more effective salts for pH adjustment and mineral additions.
