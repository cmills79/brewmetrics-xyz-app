# Beer Brewing Salts

The most common brewing salts are detailed in the table below. These salts are typically added to the Hot Liquor Tank (HLT), which serves as the ideal vessel for treating the entire volume of brewing water (for both the mash and the sparge). This ensures the salts are fully dissolved and homogeneously mixed before coming into contact with the grain.

Gypsum (Calcium Sulfate Dihydrate),CaSO4​⋅2H2​O,"Ca2+, 232.8 ppm","SO42−​, 557.8 ppm"
Calcium Chloride (Dihydrate),CaCl2​⋅2H2​O,"Ca2+, 272.6 ppm","Cl−, 482.4 ppm"
Epsom Salt (Magnesium Sulfate Heptahydrate),MgSO4​⋅7H2​O,"Mg2+, 98.6 ppm","SO42−​, 389.8 ppm"
