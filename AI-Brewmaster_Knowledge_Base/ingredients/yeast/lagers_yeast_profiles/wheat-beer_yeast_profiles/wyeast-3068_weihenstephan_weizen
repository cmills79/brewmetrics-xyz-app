Flavor & Aroma Profile:

Primary: The classic and most popular German wheat beer strain, producing a beautiful and delicate balance of banana esters and clove phenolics.

Secondary: The balance can be manipulated: ester (banana) production is increased by higher fermentation temperatures, higher wort gravity, and lower pitch rates. Overpitching can result in a near-complete loss of banana character, allowing clove to dominate.

Notes: This is a true top-cropping yeast that requires 33% fermenter headspace. It is very powdery and will remain in suspension for an extended time.

Pitch Rate Notes:
Underpitching is a common technique used to increase ester production with this strain. 1
