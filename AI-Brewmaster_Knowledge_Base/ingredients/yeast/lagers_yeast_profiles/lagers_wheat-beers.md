# Lagers & Wheat Beers Yeast and a Mastery of Fermentation

German brewing is defined by two iconic and technically demanding styles: the clean, crisp lager and the expressive, aromatic Weissbier. Each requires a distinct class of yeast and a mastery of fermentation processes that differ significantly from ale production.

Subsection A: The Foundation of Lager Brewing
Lager fermentation is conducted with strains of Saccharomyces pastorianus, a bottom-fermenting yeast that thrives at colder temperatures (typically 46-58°F / 8-14°C). This cold fermentation slows yeast metabolism, resulting in a cleaner, more delicate flavor profile with significantly lower ester and phenol production than ales. However, this process demands rigorous control. Brewmasters must manage the production of sulfur compounds, which are a natural byproduct of lager yeast metabolism, and execute a thorough diacetyl rest by warming the beer slightly at the end of fermentation to allow the yeast to reabsorb this off-flavor. Finally, a long period of cold conditioning, or "lagering," is essential for the beer to mature, clarify, and develop its characteristic smooth, crisp finish.
