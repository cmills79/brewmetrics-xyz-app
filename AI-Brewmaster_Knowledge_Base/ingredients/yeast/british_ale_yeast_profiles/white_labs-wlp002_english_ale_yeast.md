# Yeast Profile: White Labs WLP002 English Ale Yeast

Yeast Name: English Ale Yeast
Lab / Manufacturer: White Labs
Strain Code: WLP002
Type: Ale
Form: Liquid

Technical Specifications:

Attenuation: 63-70%

Flocculation: Very High

Optimum Fermentation Temp: 65째F - 68째F (18째C - 20째C)

Flavor & Aroma Profile:

Primary: Residual sweetness accentuates malt character along with mild fruity esters, adding complexity.

Secondary: Slight diacetyl production is common and should be managed with a diacetyl rest.

Notes: A classic ESB strain from one of England's largest independent breweries. Due to high flocculation, the yeast often appears coagulated or clumpy in the package, and the finished beer will be very clear.

Brewing Usage:

Role: Traditionally used for English-style ales, but its profile also makes it ideal for some American-style pale ales and IPAs where malt character is desired.

Beer Styles: English Bitter, English IPA, Mild, Porter, Stout, American IPA, Brown Ale, Hazy/Juicy IPA.

Pitch Rate Notes:
White Labs recommends a professional pitch rate of 7.5 million cells/mL for a standard ale.
