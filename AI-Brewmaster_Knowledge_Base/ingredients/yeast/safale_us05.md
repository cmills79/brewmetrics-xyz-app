# Yeast Name: Safale US-05

## Technical Specifications

Type: Ale Yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae)

Form: Active Dry Yeast

Origin: American Ale Strain

Attenuation: 78-82%

Flocculation: Medium

Temperature Range: 59-75°F (15-24°C)

Optimal Temperature: 64-68°F (18-20°C)

Alcohol Tolerance: 9-11% ABV

## Flavor Profile

Character: Clean, neutral, crisp

Esters: Very low fruity esters

Phenols: None

Diacetyl: Very low production

## Strain Background

US-05 is the dry yeast equivalent of Wyeast 1056 and White Labs WLP001 (California Ale). This strain was originally isolated from Sierra Nevada Brewing Company and has become the standard American ale yeast. It's prized for its clean fermentation character that allows malt and hop flavors to shine through without yeast-derived flavors.

## Brewing Performance

**Fermentation Speed:** Fast and vigorous, typically complete in 4-7 days

**Pitching Rate:** 11.5g packet treats 5-6 gallons (20-25L)

**Starter Required:** No, sufficient cell count for most ales up to 1.060 OG

**Rehydration:** Optional but recommended for optimal performance

## Beer Styles

**Excellent for:**
- American Pale Ale
- American IPA
- American Wheat
- Cream Ale
- American Amber/Red Ale
- American Brown Ale

**Suitable for:**
- English styles (though less traditional character)
- Belgian styles (lacks traditional esters)
- Any style where clean fermentation is desired

## Usage Instructions

**Direct Pitching:** Sprinkle directly onto wort surface, no rehydration needed

**Rehydration (Recommended):**
1. Boil 10x yeast weight in water (115g water for 11.5g yeast)
2. Cool to 80-86°F (27-30°C)
3. Sprinkle yeast on surface, wait 15 minutes
4. Gently stir and pitch within 30 minutes

**Fermentation Management:**
- Pitch at 64-68°F for optimal performance
- Maintain steady temperature throughout fermentation
- Allow natural temperature rise during active fermentation
- Cold crash to 35°F for 24-48 hours before packaging

## Storage and Viability

**Unopened:** Store in refrigerator, use by date on package (typically 3+ years)

**Opened:** Use immediately, do not store opened packets

**Viability:** >6 billion cells/gram when fresh, declines over time

**Testing:** Rehydrate small amount in warm water - should foam within 10 minutes

## Comparison to Liquid Equivalents

**Wyeast 1056:** Identical strain, liquid form allows for starter propagation

**White Labs WLP001:** Same strain, slightly different handling characteristics

**Advantages of US-05:**
- No starter required for most batches
- Longer shelf life
- More economical
- Consistent performance

## Troubleshooting

**Slow/Stuck Fermentation:**
- Check temperature (too cold slows activity)
- Ensure adequate nutrition (especially high gravity worts)
- Verify yeast viability before pitching

**Off-Flavors:**
- Fermentation too warm: Fusel alcohols, harsh flavors
- Fermentation too cold: Incomplete attenuation, diacetyl
- Old yeast: Off-flavors, poor attenuation

## Pro Tips

- **Temperature Control:** Most critical factor for clean fermentation
- **Oxygenation:** Ensure adequate wort aeration before pitching
- **Nutrition:** Add yeast nutrient for high gravity (>1.060) worts
- **Harvesting:** Can be harvested and reused 3-5 generations
- **Blending:** Mixes well with other strains for custom profiles
