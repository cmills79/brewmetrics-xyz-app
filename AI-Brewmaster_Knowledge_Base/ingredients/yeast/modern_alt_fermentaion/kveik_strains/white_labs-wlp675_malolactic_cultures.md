# Yeast Profile: White Labs WLP675 Malolactic Cultures

Yeast Name: Malolactic Cultures
Lab / Manufacturer: White Labs
Strain Code: WLP675
Type: Bacteria
Form: Liquid

Technical Specifications:

Attenuation: N/A

Flocculation: Low

Optimum Fermentation Temp: >70°F (21°C)

Alcohol Tolerance: Varies (Up to 15%)

Flavor & Aroma Profile:

Primary: This is not a yeast but a culture of lactic acid bacteria that performs malolactic fermentation: the conversion of malic acid to lactic acid.

Secondary: Lactic acid is less acidic than malic acid, which in turn decreases overall acidity and helps to soften and round out the flavors in wine or sour beer.

Notes: The culture is pH tolerant down to 3.0, but free SO2 should be less than 10 ppm.

Brewing Usage:

Role: Used in sour beer production after primary fermentation to soften and add complexity to the acidic profile.

Beer Styles: Primarily used in winemaking (Chardonnay, Red Wines) but is increasingly used by brewers in complex, wood-aged sour beers.

Pitch Rate Notes:
Used as a secondary culture; pitch rates will vary based on the specific application and desired outcome.
For sour beers, typically added after primary fermentation is complete. 1
