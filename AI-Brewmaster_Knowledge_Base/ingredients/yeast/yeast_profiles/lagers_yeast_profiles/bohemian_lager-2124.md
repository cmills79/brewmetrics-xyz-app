Flavor & Aroma Profile:

Primary: This Carlsberg-type yeast is the most widely used lager strain in the world. It produces a distinct malty profile with some ester character and a crisp finish.

Secondary: The ester character can be more pronounced when fermented at the higher end of its temperature range, making it suitable for California Common-style beers (65-68°F).

Notes: A thorough diacetyl rest is recommended after fermentation is complete.

Brewing Usage:

Role: A highly versatile strain ideal for producing malt-forward lagers like Bohemian Pilsners, but also clean enough for modern styles like Cold IPA.

Beer Styles: Czech Premium Pale Lager, Munich Helles, Festbier, Helles Bock, Dortmunder Export, Vienna Lager, Cold IPA.

Pitch Rate Notes:
Lager fermentations require a significantly higher pitch rate than ales, typically double the amount for a beer of the same gravity.
