## Pitch Rate Notes

Imperial Yeast L13 Global is a versatile strain that can be used in a variety of lager styles. It is particularly effective in producing beers with moderate to high alcohol content and a clean, crisp finish. The yeast's low flocculation helps achieve clarity without extensive filtration.

A commercial pitch rate of 50-80g per hectoliter is recommended for standard gravity lagers. For higher gravity lagers, a pitch rate of 80-120g/hL is recommended for the standard temperature range. This rate should be increased significantly (up to 200-300g/hL) for fermentations below 46°F (8°C).

Imperial Yeast recommends a pitch rate of 1.0 million cells/mL/°P for standard gravity lagers.

## Additional Context

This strain is well-suited for homebrewers and professional brewers alike, providing a reliable fermentation profile with distinctive lager characteristics. It is available in liquid form, which allows for easy pitching and consistent results.

This yeast strain is particularly popular among brewers looking to create traditional German lagers with a clean and crisp finish. Its ability to produce a range of flavors while maintaining a low ester profile makes it a favorite for those seeking to replicate the classic flavors found in German pilsners and other lager styles.

## Usage and Considerations

When using Imperial Yeast L13 Global, brewers should pay attention to the fermentation temperature, as lower temperatures can enhance the clean profile while maintaining a crisp finish. It is also advisable to pitch at the recommended rate to ensure healthy fermentation and optimal flavor development.
