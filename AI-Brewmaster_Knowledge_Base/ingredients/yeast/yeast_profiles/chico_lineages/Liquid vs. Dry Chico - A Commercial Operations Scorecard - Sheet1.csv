Factor,Liquid Chico Variants,Dry Chico Variants,Strategic Consideration
Upfront Cost,Higher per pitch,Lower per pitch,Dry yeast is cheaper for single-use or infrequent brewing.
Long-Term Cost,Becomes significantly cheaper after 2-4 repitches,More expensive if used for every batch,A repitching program makes liquid yeast the more economical choice.
Storage & Shelf Life,"Short (~3 months), requires refrigeration","Long (2-3 years), shelf-stable",Dry yeast offers superior logistical flexibility and inventory stability.
Shipping,"Requires cold-chain, more expensive","Standard shipping, cheaper",Dry yeast is more accessible for remote breweries or those looking to cut costs.
Strain Variety,"Very wide, including many unique and engineered variants","Limited, but growing","Liquid yeast is necessary for breweries seeking specific, non-standard flavor profiles."
Pitching Precision,High (can be tailored to exact cell count needs),Lower (based on package weight),Liquid yeast offers greater control for breweries with rigorous QC programs.
Ease of Use,Requires careful handling and storage,"Simple to use (direct pitch), minimal storage needs",Dry yeast is operationally simpler and reduces risk of handling errors.
Lag Time,Generally shorter,Can be longer on first generation,"Liquid yeast can lead to faster fermentation starts, potentially shortening tank time slightly."
