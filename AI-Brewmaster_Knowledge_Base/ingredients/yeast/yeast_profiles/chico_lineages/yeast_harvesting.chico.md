# Yeast Harvesting and Generational Management: A Protocol for Consistency

For breweries leveraging the cost savings of repitching, a consistent and sanitary yeast management program is non-negotiable. The goal is to harvest a healthy, vital, and genetically consistent population of yeast for subsequent batches.
When to Harvest: The ideal time to harvest yeast from a cylindroconical vessel (CCV) is after fermentation is complete and the beer has been chilled to below 40째F (4째C) for at least 24 hours. This allows the yeast to settle and compact in the cone.65
How to Harvest: The yeast in the cone will stratify into layers. The first material discharged will be dark and loose, consisting of trub, break material, and early-flocculating, less viable yeast. This portion should be discarded. The target for harvesting is the subsequent layer of thick, creamy, light-colored yeast. This is the healthiest and most vital portion of the yeast cake. The final, more liquid portion of the slurry, which contains late-flocculating and potentially less healthy yeast, should also be avoided.65 This consistent selection of the middle portion of the slurry is the single most important practice for preventing genetic drift and maintaining the flocculation characteristics of your house culture over many generations.
Storage and Handling: Harvested slurry should be stored in a sanitized, CO2-purged yeast brink or Cornelius keg. It must be kept cold (34-36째F / 1-2째C) to minimize loss of viability.65 Yeast should be repitched as soon as possible, ideally within a few days and no longer than two weeks. Yeast viability can decline by as much as 50% within seven days of storage.84
Generation Tracking: A simple but rigorous system for tracking the generation number of each pitch is essential. While Chico is a robust strain, it is advisable to limit repitching to a maximum of 5-10 generations before starting with a fresh lab culture.65 This mitigates the cumulative risk of contamination and genetic mutation that can alter the performance of the yeast. It is also a critical best practice to avoid harvesting yeast from particularly stressful fermentations, such as very high-gravity beers or heavily dry-hopped beers, as the yeast will be less healthy and less suitable for repitching.85
Yeast Viability Testing: Regular viability testing using methylene blue or similar staining methods is recommended to ensure the health of the yeast culture before repitching. A minimum of 80% viability is generally considered acceptable for repitching.86
Yeast harvesting and repitching are common, cost-effective practices in commercial breweries, allowing for the reuse of yeast for multiple generations, typically 5-10, depending on the strain, brewery practices, and quality control. However, brewers must balance cost savings with potential risks such as contamination, mishandling, incorrect pitching rates, or declining culture performance.52 Consistency in harvesting timing and temperature is paramount to ensure consistent fermentations and yeast performance in subsequent batches.52
Yeast Selection for Repitching: The genetic profile of a yeast culture can change over time due to selective mutation if harvesting practices are inconsistent.52 To maintain the desired culture profile, brewers should always select the youngest generation of yeast available.52 It is recommended to harvest from low-gravity, low-hopped beers (ideally below 6.5% ABV), as high-gravity or highly hopped environments can stress the yeast, negatively impacting future fermentations.52 Only yeast from fermentations that have exhibited normal characteristics should be harvested; the slurry should be thick, creamy, with minimal trub, and free of "off" flavors or aromas.52 Rigorous testing for purity, viability, and cell density is essential, and any culture showing concerns should be discarded.52
