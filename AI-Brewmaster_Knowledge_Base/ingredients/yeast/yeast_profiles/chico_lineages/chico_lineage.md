# Key Characteristics of the Chico Lineage

No single yeast lineage has had a greater impact on North American craft beer than the "Chico" strain. Famously isolated from the Sierra Nevada Brewing Company, this strain of Saccharomyces cerevisiae became the engine for the American Pale Ale and IPA revolution. Its defining characteristic is a clean, neutral fermentation profile that allows the vibrant character of American hops and the nuanced flavors of specialty malts to dominate the beer's profile. At the cooler end of its fermentation range, it is exceptionally crisp, while warmer temperatures can elicit subtle, complementary fruit esters of peach and citrus. Its versatility has made it the "house strain" for countless breweries.

While brewers often speak of "Chico" as a monolithic entity, the commercial versions available from different laboratories are distinct products. Decades of proprietary propagation techniques, unique nutrient regimens, and specific quality control standards at each lab have resulted in subtle but meaningful variations in performance. An assumption of perfect interchangeability is a critical operational error; a 4% difference in apparent attenuation between two "Chico" strains can result in a 2-point difference in final gravity, altering the final beer's balance, mouthfeel, and perceived bitterness. Understanding these differences is essential for recipe formulation and maintaining consistency.
