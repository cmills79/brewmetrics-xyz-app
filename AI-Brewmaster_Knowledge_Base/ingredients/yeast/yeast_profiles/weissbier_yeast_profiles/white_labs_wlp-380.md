# Yeast Profile: White Labs WLP380

Munich Wheat
Lab / Manufacturer: White Labs
Strain Code: WLP380
Type: Ale
Form: Liquid

## Technical Specifications

Attenuation: 70-76%

Flocculation: Low

Optimum Fermentation Temp: 64°F - 74°F (18°C - 23°C)

Alcohol Tolerance: 10% ABV

## Flavor & Aroma Profile

Primary: Produces a more pronounced banana (isoamyl acetate) character than WLP300, with softer clove (4-vinyl guaiacol) notes.

Secondary: Known for contributing a creamy mouthfeel and a slightly sweeter finish due to its lower attenuation compared to some other Hefeweizen strains.

## Brewing Usage

Role: Ideal for brewers seeking a Hefeweizen with a dominant banana ester profile and a rich, full-bodied mouthfeel.

Beer Styles: German Hefeweizen, Dunkelweizen, Weizenbock.

## Pitch Rate Notes

White Labs WLP380 is a vigorous fermenter. A slightly lower pitch rate than typical ale yeasts (e.g., 0.35-0.5 million cells/mL/°P) can encourage a more expressive banana character.

## Additional Context

This strain is a popular choice for those who prefer a "banana bomb" Hefeweizen. Its lower flocculation contributes to the traditional hazy appearance. While it produces clove notes, they are typically less assertive than the banana, especially when fermented at warmer temperatures. The creamy mouthfeel it imparts is highly desirable in the style.

## Usage and Considerations

* **Temperature Control**: Fermenting at the higher end of the temperature range (70-74°F / 21-23°C) will maximize banana ester production. Lower temperatures (64-68°F / 18-20°C) will still yield banana but allow more clove to come through.
* **Ferulic Acid Rest**: A mash rest at 111-113°F (44-45°C) for 10-20 minutes can increase the precursor for clove production (ferulic acid), though banana will likely remain dominant with this strain.
* **Open Fermentation**: While not always practical, traditional Hefeweizen fermentation often involves open fermenters, which can influence the yeast's behavior and flavor profile .
* **Bottle Conditioning**: Many traditional Hefeweizens are bottle conditioned, which can further enhance the yeast character and carbonation.

## Storage and Shelf Life
