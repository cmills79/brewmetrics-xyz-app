# Yeast Profile: Fermentis SafAle WB-06

Yeast Name: SafAle WB-06
Lab / Manufacturer: Fermentis
Strain Code: WB-06
Type: Ale
Form: Dry

## Technical Specifications

Attenuation: 86-90%

Flocculation: Low

Optimum Fermentation Temp: 64°F - 75°F (18°C - 24°C)

Alcohol Tolerance: 10% ABV

## Flavor & Aroma Profile

Primary: Produces a classic German Hefeweizen profile with a balanced blend of banana (isoamyl acetate) and clove (4-vinyl guaiacol) notes. It is known for its high attenuation, leading to a dry finish.

Secondary: The balance between banana and clove can be manipulated by fermentation temperature, with warmer temperatures favoring banana and cooler temperatures favoring clove.

## Brewing Usage

Role: A popular dry yeast choice for traditional German wheat beers, providing the characteristic hazy appearance and unique flavor profile. Its high attenuation makes it suitable for drier wheat beer styles.

Beer Styles: German Hefeweizen, Dunkelweizen, Weizenbock, Belgian Witbier (for a drier, more phenolic profile).

## Pitch Rate Notes

Fermentis recommends a pitch rate of 50-80g/hL (0.5-0.8g/L) for primary fermentation. For a more expressive profile with pronounced esters and phenols, a slightly lower pitch rate can be considered.

## Additional Context

SafAle WB-06 is a robust and reliable dry yeast strain that consistently delivers the iconic flavors and aromas associated with German wheat beers. Its high attenuation contributes to a drier finish than some liquid Hefeweizen strains, which can be desirable for certain interpretations of the style. Its low flocculation ensures the traditional hazy appearance of Hefeweizens. Brewers can fine-tune the banana-to-clove ratio by carefully controlling fermentation temperature.

## Usage and Considerations

* **Temperature Control**: Fermenting at the lower end of the temperature range (64-68°F / 18-20°C) will emphasize clove notes, while warmer temperatures (70-75°F / 21-24°C) will promote more banana esters.
* **Rehydration**: For best results, rehydrate the dry yeast according to Fermentis' instructions before pitching.
* **Ferulic Acid Rest**: A mash rest at 111-113°F (44-45°C) for 10-20 minutes can increase the precursor for clove production (ferulic acid).
* **Open Fermentation**: While not always practical, traditional Hefeweizen fermentation often involves open fermenters, which can influence the yeast's behavior and flavor profile.
* **Bottle Conditioning**: Many traditional Hefeweizens are bottle conditioned, which can further enhance the yeast character and carbonation.

## Storage and Shelf Life

SafAle WB-06 dry yeast should be stored in a cool, dry place, ideally below 40°F (4°C). When stored properly in its original unopened packaging, it has a shelf life of 36 months from the date of production. Once opened, the yeast should be used promptly.

## Packaging and Availability

SafAle WB-06 is available in dry form in various package sizes, from small sachets for homebrewers to larger bricks for professional breweries. It is widely available through homebrew supply stores and online retailers.
