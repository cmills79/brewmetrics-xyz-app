# Yeast Profile:  White Labs WLP300

Weihenstephan Weizen
Lab / Manufacturer: White Labs
Strain Code: WLP300
Type: Ale
Form: Liquid

## Technical Specifications

Attenuation: 74-78%

Flocculation: Low

Optimum Fermentation Temp: 68°F - 72°F (20°C - 22°C)

Alcohol Tolerance: 10% ABV

## Flavor & Aroma Profile

Primary: Produces a classic German Hefeweizen profile with a balanced blend of banana (isoamyl acetate) and clove (4-vinyl guaiacol) notes.

Secondary: The balance between banana and clove can be manipulated by fermentation temperature, with warmer temperatures favoring banana and cooler temperatures favoring clove.

## Brewing Usage

Role: The quintessential yeast for traditional German wheat beers, providing the characteristic hazy appearance and unique flavor profile.

Beer Styles: German Hefeweizen, Dunkelweizen, Weizenbock.

## Pitch Rate Notes

White Labs WLP300 is a vigorous fermenter that benefits from a slightly lower pitch rate than typical ale yeasts to encourage the desired ester and phenol production. A pitch rate of 0.35-0.5 million cells/mL/°P is often recommended for a more expressive profile.

## Additional Context

This strain is a classic for a reason, consistently delivering the iconic flavors and aromas associated with world-class German wheat beers. Its low flocculation contributes to the traditional hazy appearance of Hefeweizens. Brewers can fine-tune the banana-to-clove ratio by carefully controlling fermentation temperature.

## Usage and Considerations

* **Temperature Control**: Fermenting at the lower end of the temperature range (64-68°F / 18-20°C) will emphasize clove notes, while warmer temperatures (70-72°F / 21-22°C) will promote more banana esters.
* **Ferulic Acid Rest**: A mash rest at 111-113°F (44-45°C) for 10-20 minutes can increase the precursor for clove production (ferulic acid).
* **Open Fermentation**: While not always practical, traditional Hefeweizen fermentation often involves open fermenters, which can influence the yeast's behavior and flavor profile.
* **Bottle Conditioning**: Many traditional Hefeweizens are bottle conditioned, which can further enhance the yeast character and carbonation.

## Storage and Shelf Life

White Labs WLP300 Weihenstephan Weizen should be stored refrigerated at 34-40°F (1-4°C). For optimal performance, use by the "Best By" date printed on the package.
