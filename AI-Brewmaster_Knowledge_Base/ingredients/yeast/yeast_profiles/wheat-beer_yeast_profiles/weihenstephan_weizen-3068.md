# Yeast Profile: Wyeast 3068 Weihenstephan Weizen

Yeast Name: Weihenstephan Weizen
Lab / Manufacturer: Wyeast
Strain Code: 3068
Type: Ale
Form: Liquid

## Technical Specifications

Attenuation: 73-77%

Flocculation: Low

Optimum Fermentation Temp: 64째F - 75째F (18째C - 24째C)

Alcohol Tolerance: 10% ABV

## Flavor & Aroma Profile

Primary: The classic and most popular German wheat beer strain, producing a beautiful and delicate balance of banana esters and clove phenolics.

Secondary: The balance can be manipulated: ester (banana) production is increased by higher fermentation temperatures, higher wort gravity, and lower pitch rates. Overpitching can result in a near-complete loss of banana character, allowing clove to dominate.

## Brewing Usage

Role: The worldwide standard for authentic German-style wheat beers.

Beer Styles: Weissbier, Dunkles Weissbier, Weizenbock, Roggenbier, Sahti.

## Pitch Rate Notes

Wyeast 3068 is a versatile strain that can be used in a variety of wheat-based beers. It is particularly effective in producing beers with moderate to high alcohol content and complex flavor profiles. The yeast's ability to flocculate well aids in achieving clarity without extensive filtration.

Underpitching is a common technique used to increase ester production with this strain.

## Additional Context

This strain is well-suited for homebrewers and professional brewers alike, providing a reliable fermentation profile with distinctive German wheat beer characteristics. It is available in liquid form, which allows for easy pitching and consistent results.

This yeast strain is particularly popular among brewers looking to create traditional German wheat beers with a unique twist. Its ability to produce a range of esters and phenols makes it a favorite for those seeking to replicate the complex flavors found in classic hefeweizens. Wyeast 3068 is also known for its relatively high attenuation, which can help achieve a drier finish in the final beer.

## Usage and Considerations

When using Wyeast 3068, brewers should pay attention to the fermentation temperature, as higher temperatures can enhance the production of esters and phenols, leading to a more pronounced flavor profile. It is also advisable to pitch at the recommended rate to ensure healthy fermentation and optimal flavor development.
