## Pitch Rate Notes

WB-06 is a versatile strain that can be used in a variety of wheat beers. It is particularly effective in producing beers with moderate alcohol content and complex flavor profiles. The yeast's low flocculation helps achieve a cloudy appearance typical of wheat beers.

A commercial pitch rate of 50-80g per hectoliter is recommended.

## Additional Context

This strain is well-suited for homebrewers and professional brewers alike, providing a reliable fermentation profile with distinctive wheat beer characteristics. It is available in dried form, which allows for easy storage and use without the need for refrigeration.

This yeast strain is particularly popular among brewers looking to create traditional wheat beers with a unique twist. Its ability to produce a range of esters and phenols makes it a favorite for those seeking to replicate the complex flavors found in classic wheat beers. WB-06 is also known for its relatively high attenuation, which can help achieve a drier finish in the final beer.

## Usage and Considerations

When using SafAle WB-06, brewers should pay attention to the fermentation temperature, as higher temperatures can enhance the production of esters and phenols, leading to a more pronounced flavor profile. It is also advisable to pitch at the recommended rate to ensure healthy fermentation and optimal flavor development.
