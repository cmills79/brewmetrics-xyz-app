It is particularly effective in producing beers with moderate to high alcohol content while maintaining a balanced flavor profile. The yeast's very high flocculation helps achieve clarity without extensive filtration.

Imperial Yeast pitches contain 200 billion cells for homebrewers and are sold in "Verified Units" of 1.29 trillion cells for professionals, designed to achieve standard pitch rates.

## Additional Context

This strain is well-suited for homebrewers and professional brewers alike, providing a reliable fermentation profile with distinctive English characteristics. It is available in liquid form, which allows for easy pitching and consistent results.

This yeast strain is particularly popular among brewers looking to create traditional English ales with a clean and crisp finish. Its ability to produce a range of esters while maintaining a balanced profile makes it a favorite for those seeking to replicate the classic flavors found in British beers. A09 Pub is also known for its relatively high attenuation, which can help achieve a drier finish in the final beer.

## Usage and Considerations

When using A09 Pub, brewers should monitor the fermentation temperature closely, as it can influence ester production. Higher temperatures may enhance fruity esters, while lower temperatures can yield a cleaner profile. It is also advisable to pitch at the recommended rate to ensure healthy fermentation and optimal flavor development.

## Storage and Shelf Life

Imperial Yeast A09 Pub should be stored in a refrigerator at temperatures between 33°F and 40°F (1°C - 4°C) to maintain viability. The yeast is best used within three months of production for optimal performance, although it can remain viable for up to six months if stored properly. Always check the packaging for the best-by date before use.

## Packaging and Availability

Imperial Yeast A09 Pub is available in 200 billion cell packages for homebrewers and in larger "Verified Units" for professional brewers. The yeast is packaged in a nutrient-rich slurry that promotes healthy fermentation and can be easily pitched into wort.

The yeast is widely available through homebrew supply stores and online retailers, making it accessible for both homebrewers and commercial breweries.
