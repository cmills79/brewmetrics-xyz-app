# Yeast Profile: WLP029

Kölsch
Lab / Manufacturer: White Labs
Strain Code: WLP029
Type: Ale
Form: Liquid

## Technical Specifications

Attenuation: 73-77%

Flocculation: Medium-Low

Optimum Fermentation Temp: 58°F - 65°F (14°C - 18°C)

Alcohol Tolerance: 10% ABV

## Flavor & Aroma Profile

Primary: Produces a clean, crisp profile with subtle fruity esters (pear, apple) and a delicate wine-like character. It is known for its ability to produce lager-like qualities at ale temperatures.

Secondary: Can contribute a slight sulfur note during active fermentation, which typically cleans up during conditioning, leaving a very bright and refreshing finish.

## Brewing Usage

Role: The quintessential yeast for traditional German Kölsch beers, providing a unique balance of ale fruitiness and lager-like crispness. It is also versatile for other clean, delicate ale styles.

Beer Styles: Kölsch, Cream Ale, Blonde Ale, American Wheat, Fruit Beer (where a neutral base with subtle fruitiness is desired).

## Pitch Rate Notes

White Labs WLP029 benefits from a slightly higher pitch rate than typical ale yeasts to ensure a clean fermentation and minimize ester production, especially when aiming for a lager-like profile. A pitch rate of 0.75-1.0 million cells/mL/°P is often recommended.

## Additional Context

This strain is a classic for a reason, consistently delivering the unique characteristics of a true Kölsch. Its ability to ferment cleanly at cooler ale temperatures, combined with its subtle fruitiness and excellent clarity, makes it a favorite for brewers seeking a refreshing and nuanced beer. While it is an ale yeast, its performance often mimics that of a lager, making it a good choice for those without lager fermentation capabilities.

## Usage and Considerations

* **Temperature Control**: Fermenting at the lower end of the temperature range (58-62°F / 14-17°C) will emphasize the clean, crisp, lager-like qualities and minimize esters. Warmer temperatures (63-65°F / 17-18°C) will promote slightly more fruity esters.
* **Diacetyl Rest**: While generally a clean fermenter, a short diacetyl rest (raising the temperature by a few degrees for 24-48 hours at the end of fermentation) can ensure complete diacetyl cleanup, especially in higher gravity beers.
* **Cold Conditioning (Lagering)**: Although an ale yeast, a period of cold conditioning (lagering) at near-freezing temperatures for several weeks after primary fermentation is crucial for developing the characteristic crispness and clarity of a Kölsch.
* **Filtration/Fining**: This strain flocculates well, but fining agents or filtration can be used to achieve crystal-clear results, which is traditional for the Kölsch style.

## Storage and Shelf Life

White Labs WLP029 Kölsch should be stored refrigerated at 34-40°F (1-4°C). For optimal performance, use by the "Best By" date printed on the package.

## Packaging and Availability

White Labs WLP029 Kölsch is available in liquid form for homebrewers (PurePitch® Next Generation) and in larger quantities for professional breweries. It is widely available through homebrew supply stores and online retailers.
