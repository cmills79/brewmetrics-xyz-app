# Yeast Strains: Estery Ale

## Overview

Estery ale strains are a category of yeast that produce pronounced fruity esters during fermentation, contributing to the complex flavor profile of many traditional and modern ales. These strains are particularly valued for their ability to enhance the aromatic qualities of beer, making them a popular choice among brewers aiming for a distinctive character in their ales.

## Characteristics

- **Fermentation Temperature**: Typically range from 60°F to 75°F (15°C to 24°C), with higher temperatures producing more esters.

- **Flocculation**: Generally high, allowing for quick clarification of the beer.

- **Attenuation**: Moderate to high, depending on the specific strain, which influences the final gravity and body of the beer.

- **Aroma/Flavor Profile**: Characterized by fruity esters such as apple, pear, and stone fruit, often complemented by a slight mineral-like quality.

## Common Estery Ale Strains

### British Ale Strains

- **English Ale Yeast (e.g., Wyeast 1098, Safale S-04)**: Known for producing a balanced profile with moderate fruity esters and a clean finish. It is versatile for various English-style ales.

- **London Ale Yeast (e.g., Wyeast 1028, White Labs WLP002)**: Produces a rich, fruity character with notes of apple and pear, often used in traditional English ales and porters.

### Belgian Ale Strains

- **Belgian Ale Yeast (e.g., Wyeast 1214, White Labs WLP500)**: Known for its complex esters and phenols, contributing to the spicy and fruity character typical of Belgian ales. It thrives at higher fermentation temperatures.

- **Trappist Ale Yeast (e.g., Wyeast 3787, White Labs WLP530)**: Produces a wide range of esters and phenols, resulting in a complex flavor profile with notes of banana, clove, and stone fruit. Ideal for Trappist-style ales.

### American Ale Strains

- **American Ale Yeast (e.g., Wyeast 1056, Safale US-05)**: While primarily known for its clean fermentation, it can produce subtle fruity esters at higher temperatures, making it suitable for a range of American ales.

- **California Ale Yeast (e.g., White Labs WLP001, Safale US-05)**: Produces a clean profile with some fruity esters, often used in American IPAs and Pale Ales.

### Specialty Estery Strains

- **Kölsch Yeast (e.g., Wyeast 2565, White Labs WLP029)**: While primarily a lager yeast, it can produce estery notes at warmer fermentation temperatures, making it suitable for Kölsch-style ales.

- **Cream Ale Yeast (e.g., Wyeast 1010, White Labs WLP080)**:

Produces a clean, slightly fruity profile, ideal for light ales with a smooth finish.

## Brewing Considerations

When using estery ale strains, brewers should consider the following:

- **Fermentation Temperature**: Higher temperatures can enhance ester production but may also lead to off-flavors if not managed properly. A controlled fermentation environment is crucial.

- **Pitch Rate**: Adequate yeast pitching rates are essential to ensure complete fermentation and to avoid excessive ester production that could overwhelm the beer's balance.

- **Oxygen Levels**: Oxygen exposure during fermentation should be minimized to prevent oxidation, which can negatively affect the ester profile.

- **Diacetyl Rest**: A diacetyl rest at the end of fermentation is important to allow yeast to clean up any diacetyl produced, which can be more pronounced in estery strains.

- **Conditioning Time**: Allowing sufficient conditioning time can help esters mature and integrate into the beer, enhancing the overall flavor profile, aroma profile, with very low ester and diacetyl production. This allows the malt and hop character of the beer to be the primary focus, mimicking the crispness of a traditional lager.

Secondary: Absence of typical ale-derived fruity esters or spicy phenols. The goal is a "lager-like" profile without the need for cold fermentation.

## Brewing Usage

Role: These strains are ideal for brewers who want to produce clean, crisp beers quickly and efficiently, without the investment in lager-specific fermentation equipment or the longer conditioning times associated with traditional lagers. They offer a significant advantage in terms of tank turnover and energy savings.

Beer Styles:

- **Pseudo-Lagers**: Helles, Pilsner, American Light Lager, Vienna Lager, Märzen.
- **Clean Ales**: Cream Ale, Blonde Ale, American Pale Ale (where a neutral yeast character is desired).
- **Hard Seltzers**: Their clean fermentation makes them excellent for neutral bases.

## Pitch Rate Notes

Lallemand recommends a pitch rate of 50-100g/hL (0.5-1g/L) for primary fermentation. Higher pitch rates can speed up fermentation and ensure a cleaner profile.

## Additional Context

LalBrew NovaLager is a true *Saccharomyces cerevisiae* hybrid that has been specifically developed to produce clean lager characteristics at ale temperatures. This innovative strain combines the best attributes of ale and lager yeasts, offering brewers the ability to create crisp, refreshing beers without the traditional challenges of lager brewing. Its high flocculation and attenuation contribute to clear, dry beers, making it a versatile choice for a wide range of styles.

## Usage and Considerations

- **Temperature Control**: While NovaLager performs well at ale temperatures, maintaining a consistent temperature within its optimal range (50-68°F / 10-20°C) is still important to ensure the cleanest possible profile and prevent off-flavors.
- **Diacetyl Rest**: Although designed for low diacetyl production, a short diacetyl rest (raising the temperature slightly towards the end of fermentation) can ensure complete cleanup, especially for larger batches or higher gravity beers.
- **Nutrients**: Ensure adequate yeast nutrients, especially for higher gravity worts, to support healthy fermentation and prevent sluggishness.
- **Oxygenation**: Standard oxygenation practices are beneficial for healthy yeast growth and performance.
- **Rehydration**: For best results, rehydrate the dry yeast according to Lallemand's instructions before pitching.

## Storage and Shelf Life

LalBrew NovaLager dry yeast should be stored in a cool, dry place, ideally below 40°F (4°C). When stored properly in its original unopened packaging, it has a shelf life of 36 months from the date of production. Once opened, the yeast should be used promptly.

## Packaging and Availability

LalBrew NovaLager is available in dry form in various package sizes, from small sachets for homebrewers to larger bricks for professional breweries. It is widely available through homebrew supply stores and online retailers.
