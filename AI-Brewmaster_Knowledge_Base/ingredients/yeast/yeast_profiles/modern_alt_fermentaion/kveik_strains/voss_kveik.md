# Yeast Profile: Voss Kveik

Yeast Name: Voss Kveik
Lab / Manufacturer: Escarpment Labs (and others)
Strain Code: N/A (often sold as a culture or specific isolate)
Type: Kveik (Saccharomyces cerevisiae)
Form: Liquid (often available as dried culture from some suppliers)

## Technical Specifications

Attenuation: 75-85%
Flocculation: High
Optimum Fermentation Temp: 68°F - 95°F (20°C - 35°C), some sources suggest up to 104°F (40°C)
Alcohol Tolerance: 12-15% ABV

## Flavor & Aroma Profile

Primary: Produces clean, subtle orange and citrus notes, especially when fermented at the higher end of its temperature range. At lower temperatures, it can be remarkably neutral.

Secondary: Very low production of off-flavors (fusel alcohols, diacetyl) even at high fermentation temperatures, allowing malt and hop character to shine.

## Brewing Usage

Role: A highly versatile and robust kveik strain known for its rapid fermentation, high temperature tolerance, and clean flavor profile. It allows for quick turnaround times and can be fermented without precise temperature control.

Beer Styles: IPAs (NEIPA, American IPA), Pale Ales, Stouts, Porters, American Wheat, Pseudo-Lagers, Hard Seltzers. Its clean profile makes it suitable for almost any style where a neutral or subtly fruity yeast character is desired.

## Pitch Rate Notes

Voss Kveik, like other kveik strains, can perform well with lower pitch rates compared to traditional ale yeasts. However, standard ale pitch rates (0.5-1.0M cells/mL/°P) are also effective and can lead to even faster fermentation. For very high gravity beers, a higher pitch rate may be beneficial.

## Additional Context

Voss Kveik is one of the traditional Norwegian kveik strains, originating from the Voss region. It is highly valued for its extreme temperature tolerance, rapid fermentation, and clean flavor profile. This makes it an excellent choice for brewers looking to reduce fermentation time, save on cooling costs, or brew in environments without precise temperature control. Its high flocculation also contributes to clear beers without extensive fining or filtration.

## Usage and Considerations

* **Temperature**: While Voss can ferment at very high temperatures, ferment at the lower end of its range (e.g., 68-75°F / 20-24°C) will yield a cleaner, more neutral profile. Higher temperatures (e.g., 85-95°F / 29-35°C) will accentuate the orange/citrus notes and speed up fermentation.
* **Nutrients**: Like all kveik strains, Voss benefits from adequate yeast nutrients, especially in high-gravity worts, to ensure healthy and complete fermentation.
* **Oxygenation**: Standard oxygenation practices are recommended for optimal yeast health and performance, particularly for higher gravity brews.
* **Repitching**: Voss is known for its ability to be repitched multiple times without significant loss of performance, making it a cost-effective option for brewers.

## Storage and Shelf Life

Liquid Voss Kveik cultures should be stored refrigerated at 34-40°F (1-4°C). For optimal performance, use by the "Best By" date printed on the package. Dried kveik should be stored in a cool, dry place.
