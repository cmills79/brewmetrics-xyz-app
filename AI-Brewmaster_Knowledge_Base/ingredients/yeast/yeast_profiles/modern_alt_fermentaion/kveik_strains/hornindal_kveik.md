# Yeast Profile: Hornindal Kveik

Yeast Name: Hornindal Kveik
Lab / Manufacturer: Escarpment Labs (and others)
Strain Code: N/A (often sold as a culture or specific isolate)
Type: Kveik (Saccharomyces cerevisiae)
Form: Liquid (often available as dried culture from some suppliers)

## Technical Specifications

Attenuation: 75-85%
Flocculation: Medium-High
Optimum Fermentation Temp: 72°F - 95°F (22°C - 35°C), some sources suggest up to 100°F (38°C)
Alcohol Tolerance: 12-15% ABV

## Flavor & Aroma Profile

Primary: Produces prominent tropical fruit esters, often described as pineapple, mango, and stone fruit (peach/apricot). It is known for a clean finish despite high fermentation temperatures.

Secondary: Can also contribute subtle citrus notes. Very low production of off-flavors (fusel alcohols, diacetyl) even at high fermentation temperatures.

## Brewing Usage

Role: A highly expressive kveik strain that imparts significant fruity character while fermenting rapidly and cleanly at high temperatures. Ideal for styles where a tropical fruit ester profile is desired.

Beer Styles: NEIPA (New England IPA), Hazy IPA, American IPA, Pale Ale, Fruited Sours, Imperial Stout (to add fruity complexity), Hard Seltzer.

## Pitch Rate Notes

Hornindal Kveik, like other kveik strains, can perform well with lower pitch rates compared to traditional ale yeasts. However, standard ale pitch rates (0.5-1.0M cells/mL/°P) are also effective and can lead to even faster fermentation. For very high gravity beers, a higher pitch rate may be beneficial.

## Additional Context

Hornindal Kveik is one of the traditional Norwegian kveik strains, originating from the Hornindal region. It is highly valued for its unique tropical fruit ester profile, which is distinct from the citrus notes often found in Voss kveik. Its ability to ferment quickly and cleanly at very high temperatures makes it a popular choice for brewers looking to produce hop-forward beers with a complementary fruity yeast character, or for those seeking rapid tank turnover without compromising flavor quality.

## Usage and Considerations

* **Temperature**: Fermenting Hornindal at the higher end of its temperature range (e.g., 85-95°F / 29-35°C) will accentuate the tropical fruit esters and speed up fermentation. Even at these high temperatures, off-flavors are typically minimal.
* **Nutrients**: Like all kveik strains, Hornindal benefits from adequate yeast nutrients, especially in high-gravity worts, to ensure healthy and complete fermentation.
* **Oxygenation**: Standard oxygenation practices are recommended for optimal yeast health and performance, particularly for higher gravity brews.
* **Repitching**: Hornindal is known for its ability to be repitched multiple times without significant loss of performance, making it a cost-effective option for brewers.

## Storage and Shelf Life

Liquid Hornindal Kveik cultures should be stored refrigerated at 34-40°F (1-4°C). For optimal performance, use by the "Best By" date printed on the package. Dried kveik should be stored in a cool, dry place.
