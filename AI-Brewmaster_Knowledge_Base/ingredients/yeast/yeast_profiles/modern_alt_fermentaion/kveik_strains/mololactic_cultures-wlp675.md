# Yeast Profile: White Labs WLP675 Malolactic Cultures

Yeast Name: Malolactic Cultures
Lab / Manufacturer: White Labs
Strain Code: WLP675
Type: Bacteria
Form: Liquid

## Technical Specifications

Attenuation: N/A (bacterial culture, not fermentative yeast)

Flocculation: N/A

Optimum Fermentation Temp: 65°F - 75°F (18°C - 24°C)

Alcohol Tolerance: Up to 14% ABV

## Flavor & Aroma Profile

Primary: This is not a yeast but a culture of lactic acid bacteria that performs malolactic fermentation: the conversion of malic acid to lactic acid.

Secondary: Lactic acid is less acidic than malic acid, which in turn decreases overall acidity and helps to soften and round out the flavors in wine or sour beer.

## Brewing Usage

Role: Used in sour beer production after primary fermentation to soften and add complexity to the acidic profile.

Beer Styles: Primarily used in winemaking (Chardonnay, Red Wines) but is increasingly used by brewers in complex, wood-aged sour beers.

* Wood-aged sour beer examples:
  * * Flanders Red Ale
  * Oud Bruin
  * Lambic-style beers
  * * American Wild Ales

## Pitch Rate Notes

White Labs WLP675 is typically pitched at a rate of 1 vial per 5-15 gallons (19-57 liters) of beer or wine. The exact pitch rate can vary depending on the desired level of malolactic conversion and the specific characteristics of the beer or wine.

## Additional Context

Malolactic fermentation (MLF) is a secondary fermentation process that is commonly used in winemaking to reduce the acidity of the wine and add complexity to its flavor profile. In recent years, MLF has also gained popularity among brewers who are experimenting with sour beers.

WLP675 is a blend of *Oenococcus oeni* bacteria, which are specifically selected for their ability to efficiently convert malic acid to lactic acid. This process not only reduces the tartness of the beer but also contributes subtle buttery or nutty notes, depending on the strain and fermentation conditions.

## Usage and Considerations

* **Timing**: WLP675 is typically pitched after primary fermentation is complete, as high levels of fermentable sugars can inhibit bacterial activity.
* **pH**: The optimal pH range for malolactic fermentation is between 3.2 and 3.8. A lower pH can inhibit bacterial growth, while a higher pH can lead to off-flavors.
* **Sulfur Dioxide (SO2)**: High levels of SO2 can inhibit malolactic bacteria. Brewers should avoid adding SO2 before or during MLF.
* **Nutrients**: While not always necessary, some brewers may choose to add malolactic nutrients to support bacterial growth and ensure complete conversion.
* **Temperature**: Maintaining a consistent temperature within the optimal range is crucial for successful malolactic fermentation.
* **Monitoring**: Regular monitoring of malic acid levels (e.g., using paper chromatography) is recommended to track the progress of MLF and determine when it is complete.

## Storage and Shelf Life

White Labs WLP675 Malolactic Cultures should be stored refrigerated at 34-40°F (1-4°C). For optimal performance, use by the "Best By" date printed on the package.
