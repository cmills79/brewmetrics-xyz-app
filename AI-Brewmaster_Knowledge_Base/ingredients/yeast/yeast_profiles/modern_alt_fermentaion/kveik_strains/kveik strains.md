# Yeast Profile: Kveik Strains

Kveik (pronounced "kvike") is a Norwegian word meaning "yeast." These are traditional farmhouse yeasts that have been used for centuries in Norway to brew beer. Kveik strains are unique due to their ability to ferment at extremely high temperatures (often above 90°F / 32°C) without producing significant off-flavors, and they typically ferment very quickly.

## Technical Specifications

Attenuation: Varies by strain, but generally high (75-85%+)

Flocculation: Varies by strain, but often medium to high

Optimum Fermentation Temp: 68°F - 95°F (20°C - 35°C), some strains tolerate even higher

Alcohol Tolerance: High (often 10-15% ABV or more)

## Flavor & Aroma Profile (General)

Primary: Kveik strains are known for producing a wide range of clean, fruity esters, often described as orange, tropical fruit, stone fruit, or citrus. Some strains can also produce subtle earthy or spicy notes.

Secondary: Despite their high fermentation temperatures, many kveik strains produce remarkably clean and neutral profiles, especially when fermented at the lower end of their temperature range. This makes them versatile for a variety of beer styles.

## Brewing Usage (General)

Role: Kveik yeasts are revolutionary for brewers due to their speed, temperature tolerance, and clean flavor profiles. They allow for rapid turnaround times and can be fermented without temperature control in many homebrewing setups. They are excellent for producing clean, crisp beers quickly, and can also be used to enhance fruity characteristics.

Beer Styles:

* **IPAs (NEIPA, American IPA, West Coast IPA):** The fruity esters complement hop aromas beautifully.
* **Pale Ales:** Adds a clean, fruity character.
* **Stouts & Porters:** Can ferment these quickly and cleanly, especially if a neutral profile is desired.
* **Sours:** Some kveik strains can be used in conjunction with souring bacteria.
* **Pseudo-Lagers:** Many kveik strains can produce very clean, lager-like beers at ale temperatures, significantly reducing fermentation time compared to traditional lagers.
* **Hard Seltzers:** Their high alcohol tolerance and clean fermentation make them ideal for seltzer bases.

## Common Kveik Strains

### Lallemand LalBrew

* **LalBrew Voss Kveik**: A versatile strain known for its orange and citrus notes, fermenting quickly and cleanly across a wide temperature range.
* **LalBrew Oslo Kveik**: Marketed for its exceptionally clean and neutral profile, allowing brewers to produce lager-like beers at ale temperatures without any yeast-derived flavors.

### Escarpment Labs

* **Hornindal Kveik**: Produces tropical fruit and pineapple notes, often used in hazy IPAs.
* **Voss Kveik**: Known for its clean, subtle orange/citrus notes.

### Imperial Yeast

* **L17 Dry Hop**: While not exclusively a kveik, this clean fermenting ale strain can be used to produce lager-like beers, particularly those with a strong hop presence, and performs well at warmer ale temperatures.

### Omega Yeast

* **OYL-071 Lutra® Kveik**: Known for its "shockingly clean" profile, producing neutral, lager-like beers even at high temperatures. Ideal for pseudo-lagers, American IPAs, and hard seltzers.

### White Labs

* **WLP675 Malolactic Cultures**: While not a yeast, this bacterial culture is sometimes discussed in the context of alternative fermentation, particularly for sour beers, to convert malic acid to lactic acid, softening acidity.

## Advantages of Kveik

* **Speed**: Fermentations can often be completed in a few days, significantly reducing tank time.
* **Temperature Tolerance**: Can ferment at very high temperatures (up to 95°F / 35°C or more) without producing off-flavors like fusel alcohols. This eliminates the need for precise temperature control, making it ideal for homebrewers.
* **Cleanliness**: Despite high temperatures, many kveik strains produce remarkably clean and neutral flavor profiles, allowing malt and hop character to shine.
* **Flocculation**: Many strains flocculate well, leading to clear beers.
* **Alcohol Tolerance**: Most kveik strains have high alcohol tolerance, making them suitable for high-gravity beers.
* **Repitching**: Kveik can often be harvested and repitched many times without significant degradation in performance.

## Usage and Considerations

* **Pitch Rate**: Kveik strains often perform well with lower pitch rates compared to traditional ale yeasts, though higher rates can speed up fermentation even further.
* **Nutrients**: While robust, ensuring adequate yeast nutrients (especially FAN) can support healthy fermentation, particularly in high-gravity worts.
* **Oxygenation**: Standard oxygenation practices are still beneficial for healthy yeast growth, especially for higher gravity beers.
* **Hydration**: Dry kveik strains should be rehydrated according to manufacturer instructions.
* **Temperature Control (Optional)**: While not strictly necessary, fermenting at the lower end of the optimal temperature range can result in an even cleaner profile, while higher temperatures can accentuate fruity esters.
