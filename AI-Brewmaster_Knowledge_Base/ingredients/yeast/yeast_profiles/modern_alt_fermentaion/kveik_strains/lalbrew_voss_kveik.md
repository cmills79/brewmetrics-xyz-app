# Yeast Profile: LalBrew Voss Kveik

Yeast Name: LalBrew Voss Kveik
Lab / Manufacturer: Lallemand Brewing
Strain Code: N/A
Type: Kveik (Saccharomyces cerevisiae)
Form: Dry

## Technical Specifications

Attenuation: 78-82%
Flocculation: High
Optimum Fermentation Temp: 68°F - 95°F (20°C - 35°C), some sources suggest up to 104°F (40°C)
Alcohol Tolerance: 12% ABV

## Flavor & Aroma Profile

Primary: Produces clean, subtle orange and citrus notes, especially when fermented at the higher end of its temperature range. At lower temperatures, it can be remarkably neutral.

Secondary: Very low production of off-flavors (fusel alcohols, diacetyl) even at high fermentation temperatures, allowing malt and hop character to shine.

## Brewing Usage

Role: A highly versatile and robust kveik strain known for its rapid fermentation, high temperature tolerance, and clean flavor profile. It allows for quick turnaround times and can be fermented without precise temperature control.

Beer Styles: IPAs (NEIPA, American IPA), Pale Ales, Stouts, Porters, American Wheat, Pseudo-Lagers, Hard Seltzers. Its clean profile makes it suitable for almost any style where a neutral or subtly fruity yeast character is desired.

## Pitch Rate Notes

Lallemand recommends a pitch rate of 50-100g/hL (0.5-1g/L) for primary fermentation. Lower pitch rates can be used for more expressive ester profiles, while higher rates can speed up fermentation and ensure a cleaner profile.

## Additional Context

LalBrew Voss Kveik is a pure strain of *Saccharomyces cerevisiae* isolated from a traditional Norwegian kveik culture. It embodies the key characteristics of kveik: extreme temperature tolerance, rapid fermentation, and a clean flavor profile. This makes it an excellent choice for brewers looking to reduce fermentation time, save on cooling costs, or brew in environments without precise temperature control. Its high flocculation also contributes to clear beers without extensive fining or filtration.

## Usage and Considerations

* **Temperature**: While Voss can ferment at very high temperatures, fermenting at the lower end of its range (e.g., 68-75°F / 20-24 °C) will yield a cleaner, more neutral profile. Higher temperatures (e.g., 85-95°F / 29-35°C) will accentuate the orange/citrus notes and speed up fermentation.
* **Nutrients**: Like all kveik strains, Voss benefits from adequate yeast nutrients, especially in high-gravity worts, to ensure healthy and complete fermentation.
* **Oxygenation**: Standard oxygenation practices are recommended for optimal yeast health and performance, particularly for higher gravity brews.
* **Rehydration**: For best results, rehydrate the dry yeast according to Lallemand's instructions before pitching.

## Storage and Shelf Life

LalBrew Voss Kveik dry yeast should be stored in a cool, dry place, ideally below 40°F (4°C). When stored properly in its original unopened packaging, it has a shelf life of 36 months from the date of production. Once opened, the yeast should be used promptly.
