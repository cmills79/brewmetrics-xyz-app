# Yeast Profile: LalBrew Oslo Kveik

Yeast Name: LalBrew Oslo Kveik
Lab / Manufacturer: Lallemand Brewing
Strain Code: N/A
Type: Kveik (Saccharomyces cerevisiae)
Form: Dry

## Technical Specifications

Attenuation: 78-82%
Flocculation: Medium-High
Optimum Fermentation Temp: 68°F - 98°F (20°C - 37°C)
Alcohol Tolerance: 11% ABV

## Flavor & Aroma Profile

Primary: Produces an exceptionally clean and neutral flavor and aroma profile, allowing malt and hop character to shine. It is known for very low production of esters and phenols, even at high fermentation temperatures.

Secondary: Designed to mimic the clean fermentation characteristics of a lager yeast, but at ale temperatures.

## Brewing Usage

Role: A highly versatile kveik strain specifically selected for its ability to produce remarkably clean, lager-like beers at ale temperatures. It allows for rapid fermentation and quick turnaround times without the need for cold fermentation or extended lagering.

Beer Styles: Pseudo-Lagers (Helles, Pilsner, American Light Lager), American IPAs, Pale Ales, Cream Ales, Hard Seltzers, or any style where a neutral yeast character is desired.

## Pitch Rate Notes

Lallemand recommends a pitch rate of 50-100g/hL (0.5-1g/L) for primary fermentation. Lower pitch rates can be used for more expressive ester profiles (though Oslo is inherently low ester), while higher rates can speed up fermentation and ensure a cleaner profile.

## Additional Context

LalBrew Oslo Kveik is a pure strain of *Saccharomyces cerevisiae* isolated from a traditional Norwegian kveik culture. Unlike many kveik strains that produce fruity esters, Oslo is celebrated for its extreme neutrality, even when fermented at high temperatures. This makes it a groundbreaking yeast for brewers who want to produce crisp, clean, lager-like beers without the time, energy, and equipment investment required for traditional lager brewing. Its robust nature and rapid fermentation contribute to significant efficiency gains in the brewery.

## Usage and Considerations

* **Temperature**: While Oslo can ferment at very high temperatures, its clean profile is maintained across its optimal range. Fermenting at the lower end (e.g., 68-75°F / 20-24°C) will ensure maximum neutrality.  Higher temperatures (e.g., 85-98°F / 29-37°C) will result in faster fermentation with minimal impact on flavor neutrality.
* **Nutrients**: Like all kveik strains, Oslo benefits from adequate yeast nutrients, especially in high-gravity worts, to ensure healthy and complete fermentation.
* **Oxygenation**: Standard oxygenation practices are recommended for optimal yeast health and performance, particularly for higher gravity brews.
* **Rehydration**: For best results, rehydrate the dry yeast according to Lallemand's instructions before pitching.

## Storage and Shelf Life

LalBrew Oslo Kveik dry yeast should be stored in a cool, dry place, ideally below 40°F (4°C). When stored properly in its original unopened packaging, it has a shelf life of 36 months from the date of production. Once opened, the yeast should be used promptly.
