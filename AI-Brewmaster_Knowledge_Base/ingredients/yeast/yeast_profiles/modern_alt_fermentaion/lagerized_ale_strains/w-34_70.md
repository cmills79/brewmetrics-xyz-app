# Yeast Profile:  Fermentis SafLager W-34/70

Yeast Name: SafLager W-34/70
Lab / Manufacturer: Fermentis
Strain Code: W-34/70
Type: Lager
Form: Dry

## Technical Specifications

Attenuation: 80-84%
Flocculation: High
Optimum Fermentation Temp: 48°F - 56°F (9°C - 13°C)
Alcohol Tolerance: 11% ABV

## Flavor & Aroma Profile

Primary: Produces a very clean, neutral flavor and aroma profile, characteristic of traditional lagers. It is known for its low production of diacetyl and sulfur compounds.

Secondary: Allows malt and hop characteristics to be the primary focus, without significant yeast-derived esters or phenols. When fermented at warmer temperatures (e.g., 58-62°F / 14-17°C), it can still maintain a remarkably clean profile, blurring the line towards "lagerized" ale performance.

## Brewing Usage

Role: The most popular lager yeast in the world, known for its reliability and ability to produce classic, clean lagers. It is also increasingly used at warmer temperatures to produce "pseudo-lagers" or "cold IPAs" due to its clean profile.

Beer Styles: German Pilsner, Helles, Märzen, Vienna Lager, Bock, Doppelbock, Schwarzbier, American Light Lager, Cold IPA, Pseudo-Lagers.

## Pitch Rate Notes

Fermentis recommends a pitch rate of 80-120g/hL (0.8-1.2g/L) for primary fermentation at traditional lager temperatures. For warmer fermentations (e.g., 58-62°F / 14-17°C) or high-gravity worts, higher pitch rates may be beneficial to ensure a clean fermentation.

## Additional Context

SafLager W-34/70 is a classic bottom-fermenting lager yeast strain originating from the Weihenstephan brewery in Germany. It is renowned for its consistent performance, high attenuation, and ability to produce crisp, clean lagers with excellent clarity. Its versatility and forgiving nature have made it a staple for brewers worldwide.

While traditionally used for cold fermentation, W-34/70 has gained popularity for its ability to produce clean results even at slightly warmer temperatures, making it a bridge between traditional lager brewing and the modern "lagerized ale" movement. This allows brewers to achieve lager-like qualities with reduced cooling requirements and potentially faster fermentation times.

## Usage and Considerations

* **Temperature**: For traditional lagers, ferment at the cooler end of its range (48-52°F / 9-11°C). For "pseudo-lagers" or faster fermentations, temperatures up to 62°F (17°C) can be used, though a slight increase in subtle fruitiness might occur.
* **Rehydration**: For best results, rehydrate the dry yeast according to Fermentis' instructions before pitching.
* **Nutrients**: Ensure adequate yeast nutrients, especially for higher gravity worts, to support healthy fermentation.
* **Oxygenation**: Standard oxygenation practices are recommended for optimal yeast health and performance.
* **Diacetyl Rest**: While W-34/70 is a low diacetyl producer, a diacetyl rest (raising the temperature to 60-65°F / 15-18°C for 2-3 days at the end of fermentation) is still recommended for traditional lagers to ensure complete diacetyl cleanup. For warmer fermentations, it may be less critical but still beneficial.

## Storage and Shelf Life

SafLager W-34/70 dry yeast should be stored in a cool, dry place, ideally below 40°F (4°C). When stored properly in its original unopened packaging, it has a shelf life of 36 months from the date of production. Once opened, the yeast should be used promptly.
