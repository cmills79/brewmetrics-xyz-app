# Yeast Profile: Lallemand LalBrew NovaLager

Yeast Name: NovaLager™
Lab / Manufacturer: Lallemand Brewing
Strain Code: N/A
Type: *Saccharomyces cerevisiae* hybrid
Form: Dry

## Technical Specifications

Attenuation: 80-84%
Flocculation: High
Optimum Fermentation Temp: 50-68°F (10-20°C)
Alcohol Tolerance: 13% ABV

## Flavor & Aroma Profile

Primary: Produces a very clean, neutral flavor and aroma profile, characteristic of traditional lagers. It is designed to produce low levels of diacetyl and sulfur compounds.

Secondary: Allows malt and hop characteristics to be the primary focus, without significant yeast-derived esters or phenols.

## Brewing Usage

Role: A revolutionary dry yeast strain that allows brewers to produce crisp, clean lager-style beers at warmer ale fermentation temperatures, significantly reducing fermentation and conditioning times compared to traditional lager yeasts.

Beer Styles: Traditional Lagers (Pilsner, Helles, Märzen, Vienna Lager), American Light Lager, Cream Ale, any beer style where a clean, neutral fermentation is desired.

## Pitch Rate Notes

Lallemand recommends a pitch rate of 50-100g/hL (0.5-1g/L) for primary fermentation. Higher pitch rates may be beneficial for high-gravity worts or for achieving faster fermentation.

## Additional Context

LalBrew NovaLager™ is a true *Saccharomyces cerevisiae* hybrid developed by Lallemand through advanced yeast breeding techniques. It combines the clean fermentation characteristics of a lager yeast with the robust and fast fermentation kinetics of an ale yeast, allowing it to perform optimally at temperatures typically used for ale fermentation. This innovation provides significant advantages for brewers, including reduced energy consumption, faster tank turnover, and the ability to produce high-quality lagers without specialized cold fermentation equipment.

## Usage and Considerations

* **Temperature**: While NovaLager performs well across a wide temperature range, fermenting at the cooler end (e.g., 50-59°F / 10-15°C) will yield a crisper, more traditional lager profile. Warmer temperatures (e.g., 60-68°F / 16-20°C) will result in faster fermentation with minimal impact on flavor neutrality.
* **Rehydration**: For best results, rehydrate the dry yeast according to Lallemand's instructions before pitching.
* **Nutrients**: Ensure adequate yeast nutrients, especially for higher gravity worts, to support healthy fermentation.
* **Oxygenation**: Standard oxygenation practices are recommended for optimal yeast health and performance.
* **Diacetyl Rest**: Due to its low diacetyl production, a dedicated diacetyl rest is often not necessary, but can be performed if desired, especially for very large batches or specific styles.

## Storage and Shelf Life

LalBrew NovaLager™ dry yeast should be stored in a cool, dry place, ideally below 40°F (4°C). When stored properly in its original unopened packaging, it has a shelf life of 36 months from the date of production. Once opened, the yeast should be used promptly.
