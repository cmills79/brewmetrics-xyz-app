Alcohol Tolerance: 10% ABV

## Flavor & Aroma Profile

Primary: Produces a very clean, dry finish with low ester production, allowing malt and hop flavors to dominate.

Secondary: Can produce a subtle minerality, especially when fermented at the cooler end of its range.

## Brewing Usage

Role: An excellent choice for brewers seeking a clean, crisp ale that finishes dry, or for producing pseudo-lagers at ale temperatures.

## Pitch Rate Notes

White Labs WLP007 is a versatile strain that can be used in a variety of beer styles where a clean, dry fermentation is desired. It is particularly effective in producing beers with moderate to high alcohol content while maintaining a balanced flavor profile. Its medium-high flocculation aids in achieving clarity.

White Labs recommends a professional pitch rate of 7.5 million cells/mL for a standard ale.

## Additional Context

This strain is well-suited for homebrewers and professional brewers alike, providing a reliable fermentation profile with distinctive characteristics. It is available in liquid form, which allows for easy pitching and consistent results.

WLP007 is often highlighted for its ability to produce lager-like beers at ale temperatures, making it a popular choice for brewers who want the cleanliness of a lager without the need for cold fermentation and extended lagering times. Its low ester profile ensures that the focus remains on the malt and hop character of the beer.

## Usage and Considerations

* **Temperature**: To achieve the cleanest, most lager-like profile, ferment WLP007 at the cooler end of its range (65-67°F / 18-19°C). Fermenting warmer may introduce very subtle fruity notes but will still remain quite clean.
* **Diacetyl Rest**: While generally a clean fermenter, a short diacetyl rest (raising the temperature by a few degrees for 24-48 hours at the end of fermentation) can ensure complete diacetyl cleanup, especially in higher gravity beers.
* **Nutrients**: Standard yeast nutrient practices are recommended for optimal health and performance.

## Storage and Shelf Life

White Labs WLP007 Dry English Ale should be stored refrigerated at 34-40°F (1-4°C). For optimal performance, use by the "Best By" date printed on the package.

## Packaging and Availability

White Labs WLP007 is available in liquid form for homebrewers and in larger quantities for professional breweries. It is widely available through homebrew supply stores and online retailers.
