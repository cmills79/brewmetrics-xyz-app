# Yeast Profile: Lagerized Ale Strains

## Overview

"Lagerized" ale strains are a new category of yeast that have been specifically developed or selected to ferment like a lager yeast but at ale temperatures. These strains are often *Saccharomyces cerevisiae* (ale yeast) that have been modified or naturally selected for their ability to produce very clean, neutral flavor profiles, minimal esters, and efficient fermentation at warmer temperatures (typically 60-70°F / 15-21°C). This innovation allows brewers to produce crisp, lager-like beers without the need for cold fermentation temperatures or extended lagering times.

## Technical Specifications

* **Attenuation**: Typically high (75-85%+)
* **Flocculation**: Varies by strain, but often medium to high, leading to clear beers.
* **Optimum Fermentation Temp**: 60°F - 70°F (15°C - 21°C), allowing for ale-temperature fermentation.
* **Alcohol Tolerance**: Generally high, suitable for a wide range of beer strengths.

## Flavor & Aroma Profile (General)

* **Primary**: Characterized by a remarkably clean and neutral flavor profile, with very low ester and diacetyl production. This allows the malt and hop character of the beer to be the primary focus, mimicking the crispness of a traditional lager.
* **Secondary**: Absence of typical ale-derived fruity esters or spicy phenols. The goal is a "lager-like" profile without the need for cold fermentation.

## Brewing Usage (General)

* **Role**: These strains are ideal for brewers who want to produce clean, crisp beers quickly and efficiently, without the investment in lager-specific fermentation equipment or the longer conditioning times associated with traditional lagers. They offer a significant advantage in terms of tank turnover and energy savings.
*
* **Beer Styles**:
  * **Pseudo-Lagers**: Helles, Pilsner, American Light Lager, Vienna Lager, Märzen.
  * **Clean Ales**: Cream Ale, Blonde Ale, American Pale Ale (where a neutral yeast character is desired).
  * **Hard Seltzers**: Their clean fermentation makes them excellent for neutral bases.

## Common Lagerized Ale Strains

* **Omega Yeast OYL-071 Lutra® Kveik**: While a kveik, Lutra is specifically marketed for its "shockingly clean" profile, making it an excellent choice for pseudo-lagers at even higher temperatures (up to 95°F / 35°C).
* **Lallemand LalBrew NovaLager™**: A true *Saccharomyces cerevisiae* hybrid that produces clean lager characteristics at ale temperatures.
* **White Labs WLP007 Dry English Ale**: While an English ale strain, it can produce very clean, lager-like beers when fermented at the cooler end of its range (62-65°F / 17-18°C).
* **Imperial Yeast L17 Dry Hop**: Another clean fermenting ale strain that can be used to produce lager-like beers, particularly those with a strong hop presence.
* **Fermentis SafLager W-34/70 (at warmer temperatures)**: While a traditional lager yeast, W-34/70 is known for ts ability to produce clean lagers even at slightly warmer temperatures (e.g., 58-62°F / 14-17°C), blurring the line towards "lagerized" ale performance.

## Advantages of Lagerized Ale Strains

* **Efficiency**: Allows for faster fermentation and conditioning times compared to traditional lagers, leading to quicker tank turnover.
* **Temperature Flexibility**: Ferments at ale temperatures, eliminating the need for costly refrigeration equipment or dedicated lager fermentation spaces.
* **Clean Profile**: Produces beers with minimal yeast-derived flavors, allowing malt and hop characteristics to shine.
* **Versatility**: Can be used for a wide range of beer styles where a clean, crisp profile is desired.

## Usage and Considerations

* **Temperature Control**: While they ferment at ale temperatures, maintaining a consistent temperature within their optimal range is still important to ensure the cleanest possible profile and prevent off-flavors.
* **Pitch Rate**: Follow manufacturer recommendations for pitch rates. While some kveik-derived "lagerized" strains can handle lower pitch rates, traditional ale-derived ones may require standard ale pitch rates.
* **Nutrients**: Ensure adequate yeast nutrients, especially for higher gravity worts, to support healthy fermentation and prevent sluggishness.
* **Oxygenation**: Standard oxygenation practices are beneficial for healthy yeast growth and performance.
* **Diacetyl Rest**: While many of these strains produce very low diacetyl, a short diacetyl rest (raising the temperature slightly towards the end of fermentation) can ensure complete cleanup, especially for larger batches or higher gravity beers.
