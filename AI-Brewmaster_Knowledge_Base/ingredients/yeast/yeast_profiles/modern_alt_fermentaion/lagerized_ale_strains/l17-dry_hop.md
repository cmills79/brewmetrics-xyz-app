# Yeast Profile: Imperial Yeast L17 Dry Hop

Yeast Name: L17 Dry Hop
Lab / Manufacturer: Imperial Yeast
Strain Code: L17
Type: Ale
Form: Liquid

## Technical Specifications

Attenuation: 78-82%

Flocculation: Medium-High

Optimum Fermentation Temp: 64°F - 72°F (18°C - 22°C)

Alcohol Tolerance: 10% ABV

## Flavor & Aroma Profile

Primary: Produces a very clean, neutral fermentation profile, allowing hop aromas and flavors to dominate. It is designed to minimize yeast-derived esters and phenols.

Secondary: Can accentuate hop character, particularly in dry-hopped beers, by not competing with hop aromatics.

## Brewing Usage

Role: An excellent choice for brewers seeking a clean, crisp ale that finishes dry, or for producing pseudo-lagers at ale temperatures. Its neutral profile makes it ideal for showcasing hop varieties.

Beer Styles: American IPA, Hazy IPA, American Pale Ale, Blonde Ale, Cream Ale, Pseudo-Lagers (e.g., Helles, Pilsner), Hard Seltzer.

## Pitch Rate Notes

Imperial Yeast L17 Dry Hop is a versatile strain that can be used in a variety of beer styles where a clean, dry fermentation is desired. It is particularly effective in producing beers with moderate to high alcohol content while maintaining a balanced flavor profile. Its medium-high flocculation aids in achieving clarity.

Imperial Yeast pitches contain 200 billion cells for homebrewers and are sold in "Verified Units" of 1.29 trillion cells for professionals, designed to achieve standard pitch rates.

## Additional Context

This strain is well-suited for homebrewers and professional brewers alike, providing a reliable fermentation profile with distinctive characteristics. It is available in liquid form, which allows for easy pitching and consistent results.

L17 Dry Hop is often highlighted for its ability to produce lager-like beers at ale temperatures, making it a popular choice for brewers who want the cleanliness of a lager without the need for cold fermentation and extended lagering times. Its low ester profile ensures that the focus remains on the malt and hop character of the beer. It is particularly favored in hop-forward styles where yeast character should be minimal.

## Usage and Considerations

* **Temperature**: To achieve the cleanest, most lager-like profile, ferment L17 Dry Hop at the cooler end of its range of 64-7°F.
***Diacetyl Rest**: While generally a clean fermenter, a short diacetyl rest (raising the temperature by a few degrees for 24-48 hours at the end of fermentation) can ensure complete diacetyl cleanup, especially in higher gravity beers.
* **Nutrients**: Standard yeast nutrient practices are recommended for optimal health and performance.
* **Dry Hopping**: This strain is particularly well-suited for dry hopping, as its neutral character allows the hop aromas to shine without interference from yeast-derived flavors.

## Storage and Shelf Life

Imperial Yeast L17 Dry Hop should be stored in a refrigerator at temperatures between 33°F and 40°F (1°C - 4°C) to maintain viability. The yeast is best used within three months of production for optimal performance, although it can remain viable for up to six months if stored properly. Always check the packaging for the best-by date before use.

## Packaging and Availability

Imperial Yeast L17 Dry Hop is available in 200 billion cell packages for homebrewers and in larger "Verified Units" for professional brewers. The yeast is packaged in a nutrient-rich slurry that promotes healthy fermentation and can be easily pitched into wort.

The yeast is widely available through homebrew supply stores and online retailers, making it accessible for both homebrewers and commercial breweries.
