# Yeast Profile: Omega Yeast OYL-071 Lutra

Yeast Name: Lutra® Kveik
Lab / Manufacturer: Omega Yeast
Strain Code: OYL-071
Type: Ale (Kveik)
Form: Liquid & Dried

## Technical Specifications

Attenuation: 75-82%

Flocculation: Medium-High

Optimum Fermentation Temp: 68°F - 95°F (20°C - 35°C)

Alcohol Tolerance: 15% ABV

## Flavor & Aroma Profile

Primary: Isolated from the Hornindal Kveik culture, Lutra is famous for being "shockingly clean" with unrivaled speed when pitched at the high end of its temperature range (e.g., 90°F / 32°C).

Secondary: At its lower temperatures (e.g., low 70s °F), it produces an even more neutral and refreshing pseudo-lager character.

## Brewing Usage

Role: A revolutionary strain for brewers looking to produce clean beers quickly. It can create a lager-like beer without the long lead time of a traditional lager yeast.

Beer Styles: Pseudo-Lagers (Helles, Pilsner), American IPA, Imperial Stout, Hard Seltzer.

## Pitch Rate Notes

Omega Yeast recommends a pitch rate of 0.5-1.0M cells/mL/°P for most applications. For high-gravity beers or very rapid fermentations, higher pitch rates may be beneficial.

## Additional Context

Lutra® Kveik is a highly versatile and robust yeast strain that offers significant advantages for both homebrewers and commercial breweries. Its ability to ferment cleanly at high temperatures without producing off-flavors makes it ideal for environments where temperature control is challenging. The rapid fermentation times allow for quicker turnaround, increasing brewery efficiency.

This strain is particularly well-suited for pseudo-lagers, as it can mimic the clean, crisp profile of a lager without requiring the cold fermentation and long conditioning times typically associated with lager brewing. This opens up new possibilities for brewers who want to produce lager-like beers more efficiently.

## Usage and Considerations

* **Temperature**: While Lutra can ferment at very high temperatures, fermenting at the lower end of its range (e.g., 68-75°F / 20-24°C) will yield a cleaner, more neutral profile, akin to a lager. Higher temperatures (e.g., 85-95°F / 29-35°C) will result in faster fermentation with minimal ester production, still maintaining a clean character.
* **Nutrients**: Like all kveik strains, Lutra benefits from adequate yeast nutrients, especially in high-gravity worts, to ensure healthy and complete fermentation.
* **Oxygenation**: Standard oxygenation practices are recommended for optimal yeast health and performance, particularly for higher gravity brews.
* **Repitching**: Lutra is known for its ability to be repitched multiple times without significant loss of performance, making it a cost-effective option for brewers.

## Storage and Shelf Life

Omega Yeast liquid cultures should be stored refrigerated at 34-40°F (1-4°C). For optimal performance, use by the "Best By" date printed on the package. Dried kveik should be stored in a cool, dry place.
