# Unlocking New Aromas: Thiol-Boosting and Other Genetic Enhancements

Beyond solving process problems, bioengineering is being used to create Chico variants with unique and desirable flavor-differentiating capabilities. A significant area of development is the enhancement of thiol expression. Thiols are a class of sulfur-containing organic compounds that, at very low concentrations, can produce intense and desirable tropical fruit aromas, such as passion fruit, guava, and grapefruit. Many of these aromatic thiols exist in malt and hops in a "bound" or non-aromatic form, attached to other molecules. Certain yeast strains possess the IRC7 gene, which codes for an enzyme (β-lyase) that can cleave these bonds and release the free, aromatic thiols into the beer.55
Omega Yeast has leveraged this mechanism to create OYL-402 "Star Party," which they describe as a "Thiolized" version of the beloved Chico strain.56 This engineered variant is designed to have enhanced β-lyase activity, allowing it to unlock a "burst" of passion fruit, dank pink guava, and citrus zest aromas from the wort's malt and hop precursors, all while maintaining the clean fermentation profile and clarity of its parent strain.56 This provides brewers with a powerful tool to create intensely aromatic IPAs and Pale Ales, potentially reducing the required amount of expensive aroma hops or creating novel aroma profiles that would be impossible to achieve otherwise.
Other companies are pursuing similar paths of flavor innovation. Berkeley Yeast, for example, offers custom strain development, allowing breweries to "stack" different engineered traits into a single yeast.57 A brewery could theoretically commission a Chico strain that not only eliminates diacetyl but also produces stable haze and enhances a specific flavor profile. An example of this is their "Fresh Hazy Chico," which combines the ultra-low diacetyl trait with an engineered ability to produce a stable haze, perfect for hazy West Coast IPAs.46 These developments represent a paradigm shift, where yeast is no longer just a passive facilitator of fermentation but an active, designable ingredient for achieving specific, consistent, and unique sensory outcomes.
