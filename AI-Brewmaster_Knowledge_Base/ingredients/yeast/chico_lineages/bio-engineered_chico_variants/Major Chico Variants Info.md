# The Next Generation: Bioengineered Chico Variants and Process Innovation

The evolution of the Chico strain did not stop with its isolation and distribution by traditional yeast labs. In recent years, advancements in biotechnology have allowed for the precise genetic engineering of yeast, transforming the reliable Chico workhorse into a suite of high-performance tools. These next-generation variants are designed not only to enhance flavor but also to solve fundamental process challenges, offering commercial breweries significant opportunities for improving quality, consistency, and, most importantly, operational efficiency. The decision to adopt these strains moves beyond the brew sheet and into the realm of strategic operational and financial planning.

3.1 Eliminating Diacetyl: The Economic and Quality Impact of Engineered ALDC Expression

Diacetyl (2,3-butanedione) is a natural byproduct of valine synthesis during fermentation. Its precursor, α-acetolactate, is excreted by the yeast cell into the beer, where it can be chemically oxidized into diacetyl, which has a low flavor threshold and is perceived as a buttery or butterscotch-like off-flavor.47 In a standard fermentation, the yeast will reabsorb diacetyl later in the cycle and reduce it to the flavorless compounds acetoin and 2,3-butanediol. However, this cleanup process is slow and requires active, healthy yeast in suspension at elevated temperatures. To ensure this process completes, brewers employ a "diacetyl rest," holding the beer at warmer temperatures (e.g., 65-68°F or 18-20°C) for several days after primary fermentation has finished.47 This rest period adds significant time to the production cycle, occupying valuable fermenter space.
Yeast labs at the forefront of innovation, such as Berkeley Yeast with their FRESH™ line and Omega Yeast with their DKO™ (Diacetyl Knock Out) Technology, have engineered Chico variants to solve this problem at its source.46 These strains are modified to express the enzyme α-acetolactate decarboxylase (ALDC)
inside the yeast cell. This enzyme directly converts the precursor α-acetolactate into the flavorless compound acetoin, preventing α-acetolactate from ever leaving the cell and being converted to diacetyl in the beer.46 This effectively eliminates the formation of diacetyl, thereby negating the need for a diacetyl rest.
Crucially, research conducted by Berkeley Yeast has demonstrated that this internal, yeast-driven ALDC expression is more robust and reliable than the common practice of adding a purified, exogenous ALDC enzyme to the wort.51 Their experiments showed that while both methods were effective at reducing diacetyl during primary fermentation, only the engineered FRESH Chico strain was able to prevent a diacetyl spike after dry hopping.52 This is because the activity of the exogenous enzyme is highly pH-dependent and becomes significantly less effective at the lower pH of fermented beer (~4.4), which is precisely when "hop creep" can release fermentable sugars and trigger a new round of diacetyl production. The ALDC produced inside the yeast cell, however, operates in the cell's stable internal pH environment (~6.8) and remains effective throughout the entire process.52
The operational and economic implications of this technology are profound. By eliminating the 2-3 days typically required for a diacetyl rest, a brewery can significantly shorten its tank residency time for each batch. This faster "tank turn" allows for more batches to be produced in the same fermentation vessel over the course of a year. For a brewery operating at or near its production capacity, the primary bottleneck to growth is often the number of available fermenters. The purchase of new tanks represents a major capital expenditure. Therefore, the adoption of a bioengineered, diacetyl-reducing yeast strain is not merely a choice of a raw material; it is a strategic operational decision that functions as a low-cost alternative to capital investment. The marginal increase in the cost of the yeast is often dwarfed by the revenue generated from the additional beer that can be produced, turning yeast selection into a powerful lever for increasing profitability and throughput. A case study involving Coronado Brewing Co. reported that switching to Berkeley's FRESH strains allowed them to cut their lager fermentation time in half and eliminate the need for diacetyl testing, improving both efficiency and quality.54
