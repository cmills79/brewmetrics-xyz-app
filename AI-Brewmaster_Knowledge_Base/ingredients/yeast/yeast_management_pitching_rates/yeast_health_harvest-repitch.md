# Yeast Health: Beyond the Pitch Rate

A successful fermentation depends on more than just the number of cells. The health and vitality of those cells are paramount.

Oxygenation: Yeast requires oxygen at the beginning of fermentation not for respiration, but to synthesize sterols and unsaturated fatty acids. These compounds are essential for building strong, flexible cell membranes that can withstand the stress of alcohol production. Insufficient oxygen leads to poor yeast health and can cause stalled fermentations. Recommended dissolved oxygen (DO) levels are generally 8-12 ppm for lagers and 12-14 ppm for ales, with some high-need strains requiring even more.

Harvesting & Repitching: Reusing yeast slurry is a common and economical practice. However, it must be done with care. Yeast should only be harvested from healthy, low-to-moderate gravity fermentations. To repitch accurately, a brewery must have an in-house lab program with a microscope and hemocytometer to perform cell counts and assess viability (typically using methylene blue staining).
