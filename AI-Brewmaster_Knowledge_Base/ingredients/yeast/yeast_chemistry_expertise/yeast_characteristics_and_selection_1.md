# Yeast Strains: Characteristics and Selection for Commercial BrewingCommercia Brewing

Selecting the appropriate yeast strain is one of the most critical decisions a brewmaster makes,
as it fundamentally dictates the beer's character and influences the entire brewing process.
General Yeast Characteristics and Their Importance
Brewers must consider several key characteristics when selecting a yeast strain to ensure both
product quality and operational efficiency:
● Attenuation: This refers to the percentage of fermentable sugars in the wort that a yeast
strain converts into alcohol and carbon dioxide. 20 It directly influences the final gravity
(FG) of the beer, thereby determining its perceived sweetness, dryness, and overall
body. Different beer styles inherently require varying degrees of attenuation to achieve
their characteristic profiles.³
● Alcohol Tolerance: This characteristic indicates the maximum alcohol by volume (ABV)
a yeast strain can sustain before its metabolic activity is significantly inhibited or it
becomes inactive. 16 This is a crucial consideration for brewing high-gravity beers,
where yeast must remain active in increasingly alcoholic environments.
● Optimal Temperature Range: Each yeast strain possesses a specific temperature
range within which it performs optimally. 16 This temperature range profoundly
influences the speed of fermentation and, critically, the types and concentrations of flavor
compounds produced. Fermenting outside this optimal range can lead to sluggish
fermentation, incomplete attenuation, or the production of undesirable off-flavors.3
● Flocculation: This describes the natural tendency of yeast cells to aggregate or clump
together ("flocs") and settle out of suspension as fermentation concludes.5 Flocculation
directly impacts the beer's clarity and significantly influences the ease and efficiency of
yeast harvesting and repitching in commercial operations.5 Strains are typically
categorized by their flocculation level: low, medium, high, or very high. 16
● Flavor Profile: This encompasses the specific array of esters, phenols, VDKs, and other
secondary metabolites that a particular yeast strain produces, contributing to fruity, spicy,
clean, or other distinctive sensory notes. Flavor descriptions are rigorously derived from
a combination of analytical data, such as GC-MS, and comprehensive sensory
evaluations. 16
● Diastatic Activity: Diastatic yeast strains are distinguished by their possession of the
STA1 gene, which enables them to break down more complex carbohydrates,
specifically dextrins, that typical brewing yeasts cannot ferment. 16 This results in very
dry beers and can be desirable for certain styles. However, if unintended, diastatic
activity can lead to over-attenuation and problematic over-carbonation in packaged beer,
a phenomenon often associated with "hop creep". 23
● Biotransformation: This refers to the yeast's remarkable ability to chemically modify
hop-derived compounds, such as terpenes, into new aroma-active substances. 16 This
process can significantly enhance and diversify the hop aroma and flavor profile of the
finished beer. 24
The detailed breakdown of these yeast characteristics highlights that selecting a strain is a
multi-faceted decision, extending beyond mere flavor. It also involves considering how the yeast
will perform within a brewery's specific operational constraints, such as its flocculation for
efficient harvesting or its optimal temperature range for energy efficiency. The inclusion of
characteristics like biotransformation and diastatic activity underscores that yeast selection is
also a powerful tool for product innovation and for meeting evolving consumer preferences.
Commercial brewmasters should therefore develop a comprehensive strain selection matrix that
systematically evaluates not only the desired beer style and flavor profile but also the yeast's
performance characteristics (e.g., attenuation, flocculation, alcohol tolerance) and its interaction
with other ingredients (e.g., hop biotransformation). This systematic approach is essential for
ensuring both consistent product quality and efficient, predictable brewery operations.
