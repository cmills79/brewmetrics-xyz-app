# Saccharomyces Cerevisiae (Ale Yeasts): Characteristics and Flavor Profiles

Saccharomyces cerevisiae, commonly known as ale yeast, is the most widely used yeast
species in brewing. Traditionally, it is referred to as "top-fermenting" yeast due to its tendency to
form a dense krausen (foam) layer on the surface of the fermenting wort. These yeasts typically
ferment at warmer temperatures, generally ranging from 15−24∘C (59−75∘F).20
S. cerevisiae is highly versatile, capable of producing a wide array of flavors depending on the
specific strain and fermentation conditions.
British Ale Yeasts: These strains often produce beers characterized by diverse and crisp
profiles, frequently exhibiting a tart finish and sometimes subtle woodsy notes. 26 They are
known for contributing a range of fruity esters and distinct malty characteristics. For example,
Foggy London Ale (e.g., from Escarpment Labs) exhibits medium flocculation, an attenuation of
71-78%, and an optimal temperature range of 18−23∘C (64−73∘F), with medium-high alcohol
tolerance. Its flavor profile is described as "Fruit Salad, Citrus," and it is noted for high thiol
biotransformation, making it suitable for NEIPAs, American IPAs, and British Bitters, while also
contributing to stable haze and juicy flavors. 16 Another example, English Ale II (e.g.,
Escarpment Labs), is a very high flocculator with 72-80% attenuation, optimal at 18−22∘C
(64−72∘F), and medium alcohol tolerance. It imparts "Fruit Jam, Malty" flavors and is
considered a reliable classic for clean styles, suitable for Pale American Ales, American IPAs,
Stouts, and Porters. 16
American Ale Yeasts: These strains generally produce clean, neutral flavor profiles that allow
the characteristics of the malt and hops to dominate the beer's sensory experience.27 White
Labs WLP-001 (California Ale) is a highly versatile and forgiving strain, known for its clean,
neutral flavor, excellent attenuation (typically 73-80%), and a wide temperature range (60-72°F)
that yields predictable results. Its good flocculation contributes to clear beer, making it ideal for
American Pale Ales, IPAs, and virtually any hop-forward beer. 27 Similarly, A-72 American
Microbrewery Ale (from Brewing Science Institute) produces a soft, clean, slightly nutty profile
with a subtle tartness. It is fruitier and more flocculant than some other American strains, making
it an excellent choice for American Pale Ales and Hazy IPAs. 29
Belgian Ale Yeasts: These yeasts are celebrated for producing a remarkably complex and
abundant array of aromas and flavors. They are particularly known for pronounced fruity esters,
reminiscent of pears, plums, citrus fruits, roses, strawberries, and bananas, alongside distinctive
spicy phenolic notes, often described as black pepper or clove. Belgian strains typically possess
a high alcohol tolerance.30 The specific flavor profile achieved is highly sensitive to various
fermentation parameters, including pitching rate, oxygenation levels, fermentation temperature,
original gravity, nutrient availability, and the content of simple sugars in the wort. Examples
include White Labs Abbey IV WLP540, which offers a medium fruit character, and White Labs
Belgian Saison II WLP566, known for its fruity ester production and moderate, clove-like
phenolic notes, fermenting faster than some other Saison strains. Lallemand Belle Saison also
produces fruity, spicy, and peppery aromas due to its ester and phenol production. 30
Wheat Beer Yeasts: These yeasts characteristically produce beers with higher carbonation
levels, a full-bodied mouthfeel, and a distinctively hazy appearance, primarily due to suspended
yeast and protein content. 15 They contribute unique and traditional flavor notes such as
banana (from isoamyl acetate), bubblegum, apple, and clove (from 4-Vinyl Guaiacol), along with
other spicy or fruity esters and phenols.4 Wheat yeasts also possess the ability to metabolize
more complex sugars, allowing for a dry finish despite the beer's rich flavor profile. 15 Popular
strains include Fermentis Safale Wheat Beer (WB-06), White Labs Hefeweizen IV Ale
(WLP380), and Wyeast Weihenstephan Weizen (3068).15
spectrum of flavor compounds. This approach requires sophisticated analytical capabilities, such as Gas
Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS) for precise flavor compound analysis, coupled with a robust sensory program to consistently achieve desired flavor profiles and proactively mitigate off-flavors. Such meticulous control is particularly critical for maintaining brand consistency across high-volume production batches.
Yeast consumes the various carbohydrates present in wort in a specific, sequential order.
