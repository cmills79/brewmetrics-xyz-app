# Hop Creep and Dry Hopping Effects

Dry hopping, the addition of hops to beer post-fermentation, is a common practice
for enhancing aroma and flavor, particularly in styles like IPAs.
23 However, it can
introduce a phenomenon known as "hop creep."
Hop Creep: This occurs because hops contain enzymes that can hydrolyze
unfermentable dextrins in the beer into fermentable sugars.
23
If live yeast is still
present in the beer when these new fermentable sugars become available, it can lead
to a secondary fermentation. This results in:
● Over-attenuation: The beer ferments further than intended, leading to a higher
alcohol content and lower residual sugar.
23
● Over-carbonation: If this secondary fermentation occurs in packaged containers
(bottles or cans), the additional CO2 production can lead to dangerously high
pressures, potentially causing package explosions.
23
● Off-flavor Production: Yeast reactivating from dormancy due to hop creep can
produce undesirable off-flavors, particularly diacetyl and acetaldehyde.
23
Factors influencing hop creep include the presence of live yeast, the timing of dry
hopping (later additions are more problematic), and temperature (warmer dry
hopping can increase enzymatic activity).
23
Mitigation Strategies:
● Yeast Removal: Pasteurization or filtration to remove all live yeast before
packaging is the most effective way to prevent hop creep.
23
● Dry Hop Timing: Dry hopping early in primary fermentation can mitigate diacetyl
issues and prolonged fermentations, as active yeast can clean up byproducts.
57
However, this may lead to CO2 scrubbing of hop aromas and can make yeast
harvesting difficult.
57
If yeast is not needed for repitching, dry hop anytime before
1-2°P from terminal gravity.
57
● Yeast Health: Maintaining healthy yeast throughout fermentation reduces the
likelihood of diacetyl issues and trickling fermentations.
57
● Process Aids: Enzymes like Alphalase or ALDC (alpha acetolactate
decarboxylase) can be added to prevent diacetyl production, though they do not
prevent hop creep itself.
57 Amyloglucosidase can be used to break down complex
sugars, reducing the substrate for hop enzymes.
57
● Temperature Control: Dry hopping at colder temperatures can reduce hop
enzyme activity in the tank.
57 Allowing the beer to free rise to the top of the
temperature band after dry hopping can promote yeast activity, aiding in diacetyl
reduction and full fermentation.
57
● Salvage Options: If hop creep occurs, options include waiting for yeast to finish
trickling and reducing diacetyl, dumping the bottom portion of yeast, rousing the
tank with CO2, or adding a small amount of fresh wort or active yeast from
another fermentation to re-induce activity and cleanup.
