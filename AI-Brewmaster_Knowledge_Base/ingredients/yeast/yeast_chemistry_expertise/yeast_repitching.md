# Yeast Harvesting and Repitching Protocols

Yeast harvesting and repitching are common, cost-effective practices in commercial breweries,
allowing for the reuse of yeast for multiple generations, typically 5-10, depending on the strain,
brewery practices, and quality control. However, brewers must balance cost savings with
potential risks such as contamination, mishandling, incorrect pitching rates, or declining culture
performance. 52 Consistency in harvesting timing and temperature is paramount to ensure
consistent fermentations and yeast performance in subsequent batches. 52
Yeast Selection for Repitching: The genetic profile of a yeast culture can change over time
due to selective mutation if harvesting practices are inconsistent. 52 To maintain the desired
culture profile, brewers should always select the youngest generation of yeast available. 52 It is
recommended to harvest from low-gravity, low-hopped beers (ideally below 6.5% ABV), as
high-gravity or highly hopped environments can stress the yeast, negatively impacting future
fermentations. 52 Only yeast from fermentations that have exhibited normal characteristics
should be harvested; the slurry should be thick, creamy, with minimal trub, and free of "off"
flavors or aromas. 52 Rigorous testing for purity, viability, and cell density is essential, and any
culture showing concerns should be discarded. 52
