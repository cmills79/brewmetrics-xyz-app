# Saccharomyces Pastorianus (Lager Yeasts): Genetic Hybridization, Fermentation Performance, and Flavor Nuances

Saccharomyces pastorianus, commonly known as lager yeast, is the species primarily
responsible for the production of lager beers. These yeasts are traditionally characterized as
"bottom-fermenting" due to their tendency to settle at the bottom of the fermenter as
fermentation progresses.5
S. pastorianus is a unique genetic hybrid, resulting from the natural hybridization of
Saccharomyces cerevisiae (ale yeast) and the cold-tolerant wild yeast Saccharomyces
eubayanus. This remarkable hybridization combines the robust fermentative vigor of S.
cerevisiae with the advantageous low-temperature optimum of S. eubayanus. 32 Lager yeasts
typically ferment at cooler temperatures, generally ranging between 7−13∘C (45−55∘F). 20
They are highly valued for producing clean, crisp, and subtle flavor profiles with minimal esters
or phenols, which allows the delicate characteristics of the malt and hops to shine through
unimpeded. 24
S. pastorianus strains are broadly categorized into two main genetic groups: Group I ('Saaz')
and Group II ('Frohberg'), distinguished by their genetic differences and chromosome copy
numbers. Group II strains have become globally dominant in commercial brewing due to their
more robust fermentation kinetics, consistently neutral aroma profile, and lower production of
common off-aromas such as acetaldehyde and diacetyl. 24 To fully develop their characteristic
clean finish and achieve their full potential, lager yeasts generally require extended fermentation
and conditioning (lagering) times. 25
A prime example of a widely used and reliable lager strain is Fermentis Saflager W-34/70. This
strain is known for its exceptionally clean fermentation profile, excellent cold tolerance
(fermenting as low as 48°F), and superior flocculation, which contributes to brilliant beer clarity.
It is also widely available in dry form, facilitating easy storage and use, and is perfect for
Pilsners, Märzens, and other traditional German lagers. 27 Other highly recommended strains
for various lager styles include Czech 34/70, Bavarian Helles, German Lager 3470, Augustiner
Lager, and Mexican Lager BSI-940, as well as various specialized Pilsner and Bock lager
strains. 34
The genetic origin of S. pastorianus provides a direct explanation for its robust performance in
cold environments and its characteristically clean flavor profile. The dominance of Group II
strains in commercial brewing, attributable to their robust fermentation kinetics and minimal
off-flavor production, directly translates into a significant commercial advantage for large-scale
lager production. In this segment, consistency and the absence of undesirable flavors are
paramount. Therefore, for commercial lager production, selecting robust S. pastorianus strains
(often from Group II) that are known for minimal off-flavor production is critical. This strategic
choice, combined with precise temperature control throughout both the primary fermentation
and the extended lagering phase, is fundamental to consistently achieving the desired clean,
crisp profile across high-volume batches.
