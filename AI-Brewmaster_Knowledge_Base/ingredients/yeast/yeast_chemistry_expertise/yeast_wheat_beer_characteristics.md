# Wheat Beer Yeasts

These yeasts characteristically produce beers with higher carbonation
levels, a full-bodied mouthfeel, and a distinctively hazy appearance, primarily due to suspended
yeast and protein content. 15 They contribute unique and traditional flavor notes such as
banana (from isoamyl acetate), bubblegum, apple, and clove (from 4-Vinyl Guaiacol), along with
other spicy or fruity esters and phenols.4 Wheat yeasts also possess the ability to metabolize
more complex sugars, allowing for a dry finish despite the beer's rich flavor profile. 15 Popular
strains include Fermentis Safale Wheat Beer (WB-06), White Labs Hefeweizen IV Ale
(WLP380), and Wyeast Weihenstephan Weizen (3068).15
Kveik Yeasts: Originating from Norwegian farmhouse brewing traditions, Kveik strains have
gained significant popularity for their exceptional resilience and rapid fermentation capabilities.
25 They can complete fermentation extremely quickly, often within 1-3 days, and are capable of
fermenting cleanly at very high temperatures, sometimes exceeding 40∘C (104∘F) 25 Kveik
strains produce distinct fruity esters, such as citrus, mango, or pineapple, with the specific
profile varying by strain, and generally exhibit high alcohol tolerance. 25 Their ability to ferment
cleanly at ale temperatures while producing a crisp, clean profile has made them popular for
brewing "pseudo-lagers". 31
Achieving consistent and desired flavor profiles with S. cerevisiae strains in commercial brewing
requires precise control over fermentation parameters tailored to each specific strain. This
means moving beyond generic "ale fermentation" guidelines. Instead, it involves implementing
nuanced temperature ramps, carefully controlled oxygenation levels, and precise pitching rates
to optimize the production of desired secondary metabolites and ensure batch-to-batch sensory
consistency. This meticulous approach is fundamental to maintaining product quality and brand
integrity at scale.
Yeast consumes the various carbohydrates present in wort in a specific, sequential order.
Monosaccharides, such as glucose and fructose, are fermented first, followed by disaccharides
like sucrose and maltose, and finally, the trisaccharide maltotriose.5 The ability of a particular yeast strain to ferment maltotriose can vary significantly, impacting the final attenuation and perceived sweetness of the beer
