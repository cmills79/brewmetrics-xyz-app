# Yeast Propagation and Management

Yeast propagation in a commercial brewery aims to produce a larger quantity of healthy,
contamination-free yeast biomass to ensure uniform and stable fermentations. 55 This practice
can be cost-effective, especially for breweries using multiple strains or brewing infrequently,
where repitching harvested yeast might be impractical.55
A fundamental rule for yeast propagation is to avoid exceeding a 10-fold increase in volume at
each step. 55 The timing for stepping up the yeast depends on reaching peak cell density, which
is influenced by temperature and the initial pitch rate. It is crucial to confirm a 50-75% gravity
drop before increasing the volume. 55 All propagations should ideally be performed at 68∘F
(20∘C), with the fermentation temperature adjustable only on the final step. 55 A typical
1-Step-10-Fold propagation usually achieves peak cell density in approximately 48 hours. 55
1-Step-10-Fold Propagation Example: For a 20 BBL (23 hL) final fermentation volume, a 2
BBL (2.3 hL) propagation is required. This involves inoculating 2 BBL of well-oxygenated wort at
70°F (21°C) with 2.0 Liters of fresh yeast. After 48 hours or a 50-75% gravity drop, an additional
18 BBL (21 hL) of wort is added on top. The goal is to achieve a cell count of 10-12 million cells
per milliliter, which should then yield 5-6 million cells per milliliter in the final 20 BBL volume. 55
Typical pitch rates for this method are 1 liter per Barrel or Hectoliter for ales and wheats, and 2
liters per Barrel or Hectoliter for lagers and high-gravity beers. 55
Essential quality control procedures, applicable to all breweries, include routine cell counting,
viability testing, and microbiological testing of the propagated yeast. 55 Relying on guesswork in
yeast propagation can lead to significant troubleshooting difficulties and compromised beer
