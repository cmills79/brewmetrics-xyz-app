# Timing of Yeast Harvest

● Cylindroconical and Dish Bottom Vessels (Bottom Cropping): Yeast should be
harvested once the temperature drops below 40∘F (4∘C) and the trub has been fully
discharged, typically within 48 hours of fermentation completion. 52 This ensures a
clean, homogenous slurry. 52 When cropping from conical fermenters, three layers
typically form: trub/dead yeast at the bottom, ideal healthy yeast in the middle, and poor
flocculating/thin yeast at the top. The middle layer contains the best cells for repitching.

● Open Vessels (Top Cropping): Yeast can be harvested once the gravity has dropped
below 50% of the original gravity. 52 The initial "dirt skim" (first head) should be
discarded, and the clean, second head should be harvested. 52
Quantity and Storage: An increased pitching rate is often recommended for harvested yeast
compared to fresh laboratory cultures, as harvested yeast may have reduced sterols, enzymes,
or glycogen due to previous stress. 52 The traditional rule is 1-2 million cells per mL per degree
Plato. 52 Yeast should be used as soon as possible, ideally within two weeks, and stored
between 34-36°F (1-2°C) in an oxygen-free, dark environment to minimize degradation. 52 A
slight CO2 head pressure (<5 lbs) can maintain a positive pressure, but excessive pressure is
detrimental.52 Storage vessels (brinks) must be easy to clean, sanitize, and allow for pressure
relief and CO2 purging to minimize oxygen exposure. 52 Overfilling brinks should be avoided
due to CO2 expansion. 53 Storing yeast in the fermenter for extended periods is not
recommended due to uneven temperature regulation and reduced viability. 53
Acid Washing: Some commercial breweries acid wash yeast, typically with Food Grade
Phosphoric acid (H3PO4) or Chlorine Dioxide (ClO2), before pitching to reduce bacterial
contamination. This involves lowering the pH to 2.1-2.5 at 34-36°F (2−4∘C) with gentle agitation
for 1-2 hours. However, this process does not eliminate wild yeast and can stress the yeast if
not performed correctly. 52
