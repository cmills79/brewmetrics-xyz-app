# Yeast's Role as Energy Currency in Brewing

Another method for assessing yeast vitality is the bioluminescence adenosine triphosphate
(ATP) assay. 49 Since ATP is the cell's energy currency, its concentration directly reflects
metabolic activity. A high intracellular pH (ICP), often measured via fluorescence photometry or
flow cytometry using dyes like CF-DA, also indicates high yeast vitality and metabolic activity. 42
These advanced methods provide a more complete and sensitive understanding of a yeast
culture's suitability for fermentation compared to basic viability measurements. 47
This is particularly important in large-scale operations where yeast health can directly impact
fermentation kinetics, flavor profiles, and overall product quality. By employing these
sophisticated techniques, commercial brewmasters can ensure that their yeast cultures are not only viable but also metabolically active and ready for optimal fermentation performance.
