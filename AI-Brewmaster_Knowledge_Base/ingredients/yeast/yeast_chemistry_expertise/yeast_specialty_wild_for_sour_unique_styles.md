# Specialty and Wild Yeasts: Brettanomyces, Lactobacillus, Pediococcus for Sour and Unique Styles

While Saccharomyces species are the primary workhorses for producing "clean" beers,
specialty and wild microorganisms are intentionally employed in commercial brewing to create
distinctive sour and other unique beer styles. These often involve complex mixed fermentations,
where multiple yeast and bacterial species work in synergy. 35
Brettanomyces (Brett): This is a genus of wild yeast, not bacteria, and is a principal
component in the production of many sour and funky beer styles.35 Brett strains typically
ferment much more slowly than Saccharomyces, with the full development of their characteristic
flavors sometimes taking months or even years. 35 They produce distinctive funky flavors and
aromas that can range from pleasant notes of pineapple and hay to more intense characteristics
like horse blanket or acrid smoke, depending on the specific strain and the available precursor
compounds in the beer.4 Brett also possesses the unique ability to metabolize complex sugars
(dextrins) that Saccharomyces cannot, potentially leading to very dry beers and a risk of
over-carbonation if not carefully managed in packaged products. 36
Lactobacillus (Lacto): This is a genus of lactic acid bacteria, not yeast, and is the primary
microorganism responsible for producing the clean, tart sourness found in many sour beers. 35
Lactobacillus consumes sugars in the wort and converts them primarily into lactic acid, which
rapidly lowers the liquid's pH (often within 24-48 hours). 35 This bacterium is also commonly
found in various food fermentations, such as kimchi and yogurt, and generally produces a
relatively clean sour taste with minimal other flavor compounds. 35
Pediococcus (Pedio): Similar to Lactobacillus, Pediococcus is a genus of lactic acid bacteria
that produces lactic acid during fermentation, contributing to sourness. 35 However,
Pediococcus is often considered more "wild" and unpredictable than Lactobacillus and can
produce additional funky aromas and flavors, sometimes resulting in a harsher sourness. A
notable byproduct of Pediococcus metabolism is diacetyl, which can impart a buttery or
"popcorn" flavor. 35 Unlike brewer's yeast, Pediococcus does not reduce diacetyl, so it often
requires the co-fermentation with Brettanomyces to eliminate this off-flavor. 35
The intentional use of these specialty and wild microorganisms requires careful management to
prevent cross-contamination in breweries that also produce "clean" beers. 25 Strict segregation
of equipment, dedicated fermentation vessels, and rigorous sanitation protocols are essential to
avoid unintended souring or off-flavors in standard beer lines.
