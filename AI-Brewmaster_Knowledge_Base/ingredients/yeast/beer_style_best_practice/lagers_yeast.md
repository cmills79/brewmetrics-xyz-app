# Lagers

Lagers are renowned for their clean, crisp, and subtle flavor profiles, allowing malt and
hop characteristics to shine.

● Yeast Selection: Primarily Saccharomyces pastorianus strains (lager yeasts),
known for minimal ester and phenol production.
25 Fermentis Saflager W-34/70 is a
popular choice for its clean fermentation and cold tolerance.
27
● Fermentation Temperature: Lagers are fermented at cooler temperatures,
typically 7–13°C (45–55°F).
20 Pitching yeast slightly cooler (e.g., 8°F/4°C below
target) and allowing a gradual temperature rise is common.

● Diacetyl Rest: While some traditional lagers may tolerate very low diacetyl levels,
a diacetyl rest is often employed to ensure complete cleanup of buttery
off-flavors.
18 This involves raising the fermentation temperature by 3-5°F (e.g., to
65-70°F for lagers) once 40-50% attenuation is reached, holding for several days
to allow yeast to reabsorb diacetyl.
18
● Lagering (Cold Conditioning): Extended cold conditioning at temperatures
around 30°F (-1°C) for 3-8 weeks (or roughly 1 week per °Plato of original gravity)
is essential for flavor maturation and cleanup.
33 Gradual temperature reduction
during cooling prevents yeast shock, allowing them to remain active for cleanup
even at low temperatures.
33
● Trub Management: Minimizing trub carryover from the kettle to the fermenter
and regularly purging yeast from the conical fermenter cones (e.g., twice per
week after harvesting) helps prevent autolysis off-flavors.
