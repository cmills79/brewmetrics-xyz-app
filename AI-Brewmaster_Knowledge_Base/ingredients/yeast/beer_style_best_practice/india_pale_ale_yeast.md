# India Pale Ales (IPAs)

IPAs are characterized by their prominent hop aroma and flavor, often with a clean or
fruity yeast profile. New England IPAs (NEIPAs) specifically aim for stable haze and
juicy fruit notes.
● Yeast Selection: Strains that complement hop character, often producing fruity
esters or contributing to haze. "Conan" (e.g., Omega DIPA, Escarpment Labs
Vermont Ale) is famous for NEIPAs, contributing tropical and fruity esters, and
stable haze.
64 Foggy London Ale (Escarpment Labs) also accentuates tropical
fruit notes and contributes to haze.
16 American Ale strains like White Labs
WLP-001 or BSI's A-72 provide a clean, neutral canvas for hops.

● Biotransformation: Selecting yeast strains with high biotransformation
capabilities (e.g., Vermont Ale) can enhance hop aroma by converting hop
compounds into new aroma-active substances.
16
● Dry Hopping: This is critical for IPA aroma. Timing is important: dry hopping early
in fermentation can mitigate diacetyl issues and prolonged fermentations, though
it may scrub some aroma.
57 Late dry hopping (after terminal gravity, under
pressure, with minimal oxygen) maximizes aroma retention.
65 High dry hop rates
(e.g., 3-4 lbs/bbl or even 4.4 lbs/bbl for some breweries) are common, though
they can lead to increased beer losses.
65
● Temperature Control: Fermentation temperatures typically range from 65°F to
low-to-mid 70s for "Conan" strains.
64 While some esters are desired, controlling
temperature prevents excessive, undesirable banana notes.
66
● Hop Creep Management: Given the heavy dry hopping, vigilance against hop
creep (over-attenuation, over-carbonation, diacetyl) is crucial.
23 Strategies
include careful dry hop timing, ensuring healthy yeast, and potentially using
process aids like ALDC.
