# Wheat Beers

Wheat beers are characterized by their distinctive banana and clove notes, hazy
appearance, and full body.
● Yeast Selection: Specific wheat beer yeast strains are paramount, as they are
responsible for the characteristic banana (isoamyl acetate) and clove (4-Vinyl
Guaiacol/4VG) flavors.
13 Popular strains include Wyeast Weihenstephan Weizen
(3068), White Labs Hefeweizen IV Ale (WLP380), and Fermentis Safale Wheat
Beer (WB-06).

● Mash Profile: Traditional German wheat beers often use decoction or step
mashes. These methods help break down high protein levels (common in wheat
malt) to prevent stuck mashes and chill haze, while also increasing available
amino acids and enhancing malt flavor.
68 A protein rest (e.g., 95-99°F) and
potentially a ferulic acid rest (e.g., minimum 113°F) can encourage 4VG
production.

● Temperature Control: Fermentation temperature significantly influences the
balance of banana esters and clove phenols.
13 Higher temperatures generally
promote ester production, while specific rests can enhance phenols.
13
● Haze and Body: The high protein content of wheat malt contributes to foam
stability and mouthfeel but also to the characteristic haze.
69 Wheat yeasts
typically remain in suspension, contributing to the beer's cloudy appearance.
15
● Pitching Rate and Aeration: Under-pitching may increase esters.
13 Many
breweries pitch 5-10 million cells/mL for wheat beers, with higher rates (15-20
million cells/mL) for Weizenbocks.
13 Decreasing wort aeration can also support
ester production.
