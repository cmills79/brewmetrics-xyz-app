# Sour Beers

Sour beers are intentionally acidic, ranging from subtly tangy to assertively acidic,
often with complex funky notes.
● Microorganism Selection: Unlike clean beers, sour beers typically involve mixed
fermentations with Saccharomyces yeast alongside specific wild yeasts and
bacteria.
35
○ Saccharomyces cerevisiae: Often used as a foundational yeast for gravity
reduction and alcohol production.
35
○ Lactobacillus: Primary bacteria for clean lactic acid sourness, rapidly
lowering pH.
35 Used in kettle sours or co-fermented.
○ Pediococcus: Also produces lactic acid, but can be wild and unpredictable,
sometimes creating diacetyl and a harsher sourness. Often used with
Brettanomyces to mitigate diacetyl.
35
○ Brettanomyces: A wild yeast that ferments slowly, contributing funky, earthy,
or fruity esters (e.g., pineapple, horse blanket). It can also consume dextrins
and reduce diacetyl.

○ Acetobacter: Less common, consumes ethanol to produce harsh acetic acid
(vinegar) and requires oxygen. Generally minimized, but intentionally used in
small amounts for styles like Flanders Reds.
35
● Souring Methods:
○ Kettle Souring: Wort is soured with Lactobacillus (or other acid-producing
bacteria) in the kettle before boiling, which kills the bacteria and sets the
sourness. This offers a clean, controlled sour profile.
70
○ Traditional Souring/Mixed Fermentation: Involves long-term fermentation
with multiple organisms (e.g., Saccharomyces, Brettanomyces, Lactobacillus,
Pediococcus) in barrels or dedicated fermenters. This yields complex, evolving
flavors but requires patience and vigilance against unwanted spoilage.
70
○ Acid-Producing Yeast: Bioengineered Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains
(e.g., Sourvisiae®) can produce lactic acid in addition to alcohol in a single
step, simplifying the process and reducing contamination risks.
71
● pH Control: Monitoring and controlling pH is critical. Initial acidification (e.g., with
lactic or phosphoric acid) can discourage spoilage bacteria.
70
● Oxygen Management: Crucial for managing acetic acid production, as
Acetobacter requires oxygen to convert ethanol to acetic acid.
35
● Yeast Strain Selection: Specific strains are chosen based on desired flavor profiles
and fermentation characteristics.
○ For example, Omega DIPA (Conan) is known for its tropical fruit esters and
stable haze, making it suitable for NEIPAs and American IPAs.
○ Foggy London Ale (Escarpment Labs) enhances tropical fruit notes and
contributes to haze stability.
○ British Ale strains like Foggy London Ale and English Ale II (Escarpment
Labs) are known for their crisp, fruity profiles and medium-high thiol
biotransformation, making them suitable for a range of styles from NEIPAs to
Porters.
● Fermentation Temperature: Typically ranges from 18−24∘C (64−75∘F) for mixed
fermentations, with careful temperature control to manage ester production and
prevent excessive banana notes.
● Dry Hopping: Common in sour IPAs, but requires careful management to avoid
over-attenuation and diacetyl production
