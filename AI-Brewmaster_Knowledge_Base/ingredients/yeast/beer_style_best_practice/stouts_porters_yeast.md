# Stouts and Porters

Stouts and porters are known for their rich malt complexity, dark color, and often full
body.
● Yeast Selection: Yeast strains are typically chosen to allow the complex malt
flavors to shine, either by being neutral or by producing complementary ester
profiles. British Ale strains (e.g., Wyeast British Ale 1098, White Labs British Ale
WLP005) are common for their malty character and clean finish.
28 American Ale
strains like White Labs WLP001 can also provide a clean base.

● High Gravity Considerations: Imperial stouts, being high-gravity beers, require
robust yeast management. This often involves over-pitching and
over-oxygenating liquid yeast to handle the high alcohol content and fermentable
sugars.

● Yeast Generations: Using second or third-generation yeast can be beneficial for
imperial stouts, as the yeast may be more acclimated to the brewery's
conditions.

● Body and Mouthfeel: The use of flaked wheat and oats is common to enhance
body, mouthfeel, and head retention.
67 Maltodextrin can also be added to support
a high finishing gravity and maintain body.

● Adjuncts: Stouts often incorporate adjuncts like lactose (for milk stouts), cocoa
nibs, coffee, or spices. Yeast selection should consider how it interacts with these
additions; neutral yeasts are often preferred for classic milk stouts.
