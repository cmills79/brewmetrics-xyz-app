# Abbey & Trappist Strains

The legendary beers of Belgium's Trappist monasteries are fermented with unique yeast strains that have been cultivated for centuries. These strains are prized for their ability to ferment high-gravity worts while producing a rich tapestry of flavors. Key esters include notes of dark fruit, plum, pear, and cherry, while phenols contribute spicy, peppery, and sometimes clove-like notes. A critical aspect of brewing these styles is the careful management of fermentation temperature. A rising temperature profile during fermentation is often employed to encourage full attenuation and develop the desired complexity, but if not controlled, it can lead to an overproduction of fusel alcohols and an unbalanced, "hot" character in the final beer.
Abbey and Trappist yeast strains typically exhibit high alcohol tolerance, often exceeding 10-12% ABV, making them well-suited for the strong ales characteristic of these traditions. They also tend to have moderate to high flocculation, which aids in clarifying the beer post-fermentation. However, this trait requires careful timing of racking and conditioning to ensure that sufficient yeast remains in suspension to complete fermentation and allow for proper maturation of flavors.
In contrast
to many modern ale strains, Abbey and Trappist yeasts often ferment more slowly, necessitating longer fermentation and conditioning periods. This extended timeline allows for the gradual development of complex flavor profiles, including the reduction of diacetyl and other off-flavors. The result is a beer that is not only robust and flavorful but also well-balanced and smooth, embodying the rich brewing heritage of Belgium's monastic traditions.
