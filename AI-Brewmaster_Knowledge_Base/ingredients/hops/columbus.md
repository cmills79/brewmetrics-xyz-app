Notes: Originally bred by Charles Zimmerman as part of a USDA breeding program in the 1970s, Columbus is commonly referred to as part of the CTZ group (Columbus, Tomahawk®, Zeus). The CTZ mix of hops was the number one hop in terms of production yield in the United States in 2019, with over 17 million pounds harvested. This dominance highlights the commercial importance of high-alpha bittering hops, demonstrating that efficient and clean bitterness remains a fundamental requirement for large-scale brewing, even amidst the strong focus on aroma. The "dank" or "cannabis-like" aroma descriptors for Columbus, while potentially polarizing, have found a significant niche in certain craft beer styles, particularly West Coast IPAs, illustrating how unique flavor profiles can become commercially viable and even desirable.

Brewing Usage:

Role: A dual-purpose hop, providing both bittering and aroma. Its strong flavor and aroma make it particularly effective for late additions to the boil or for dry-hopping.

Beer Styles: Imperial Brown Ale, Barley Wine, Imperial Stout, American Ales, Stout. Also used in IPAs.

Commercial Examples: While specific single-hop examples are not widely cited, Columbus is a key component in multi-hop beers such as Sierra Nevada Dankful IPA (used with Chinook, Mosaic, Nelson Sauvin, Zappa, Idaho 7, and Ekuanot).

Substitution Suggestions: CTZ , Tomahawk , Zeus , Centennial , Chinook , Galena , Nugget , Millennium , Warrior , Bullion.

Additional Notes: Columbus is available in lupulin powder form, including Cryo/LupuLN2, Lupomax, and Hopsteiner products, which are concentrated lupulin powders that add significant flavor in whirlpool or dry hop additions.
