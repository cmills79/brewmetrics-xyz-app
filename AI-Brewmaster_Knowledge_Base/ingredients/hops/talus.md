Notes: Talus is a relatively new hop variety released in 2020 by Hop Breeding Company (HBC). It is a daughter of Sabro and known for its bold, complex, and unique aroma profile that stands out even among modern hop varieties. It offers a distinct combination of intense citrus, especially pink grapefruit, alongside resinous pine, tropical fruit, and sometimes subtle floral or woody notes. Its multifaceted character makes it a versatile hop for brewers looking to create innovative and highly aromatic beers.

## Brewing Usage

Role: Dual-purpose hop, highly valued for late additions, whirlpool, and dry hopping to maximize its intense and complex flavor and aroma contributions. Can also be used for bittering.

Beer Styles: American IPA, Hazy IPA, Pale Ale, NEIPA, Session IPA, American Wheat, Fruited Sours.

## Commercial Examples

As a newer hop, it's rapidly being adopted by craft breweries. Look for single-hop Talus IPAs or beers where it's featured prominently in the hop bill.

Substitution Suggestions: Due to its unique profile, direct substitutions are difficult. Brewers might blend hops like Citra (for citrus), Sabro (for some unique notes), or Chinook (for pine/grapefruit) to approximate certain aspects.

## Storage and Shelf Life

Hops are best stored in a cool (32-41°F or 0-5°C), dark, and oxygen-free environment to preserve their delicate aromas and alpha acids. Vacuum-sealed packaging or nitrogen-flushed bags are ideal. When stored properly, Talus  maintain their quality for 3-5 years.
