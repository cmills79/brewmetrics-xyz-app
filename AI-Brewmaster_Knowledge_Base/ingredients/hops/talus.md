Notes: Talus, previously known as HBC 692, was released in 2020 by the Hop Breeding Company, a joint venture between John I. Haas and Yakima Chief Ranches. It is the result of a hybrid pollination of Sabro and open pollination. While a daughter of Sabro, its signature coconut aroma and flavor are notably softer and more subdued than in Sabro. Talus is recognized for its robust performance and ability to deliver consistent flavor outcomes. Its unique and impactful aromas are known to persist throughout the brewing process.

Brewing Usage:

Role: Primarily an aroma hop. It is typically used as a late boil addition and for dry hopping. Brewers have also noted that its near 1:1 ratio of alpha to beta acids can create a "harmonious" bitterness if used earlier in the process, a characteristic highly sought after by German brewers for pilsners. Its versatility makes it suitable for many beer styles, particularly hop-forward beers.

Beer Styles: IPAs, DIPAs, IPLs. Popular for hop-forward beers and light beers like Pale Ales and Pilsners. Also used in NEIPA and West Coast IPA styles.

Commercial Examples: Single Hill Fresh Hop Lateral A (used with wet and kilned HBC 586) , Fremont Brewing Space Rex Hazy (used with Centennial and Mosaic) , Fremont Brewing Head Full Fresh Hop Hazy (used with Mosaic).

Substitution Suggestions: Citra , Mosaic , Simcoe , Sabro. While one source states "No Replacement" , other sources provide pairing and substitution suggestions.
