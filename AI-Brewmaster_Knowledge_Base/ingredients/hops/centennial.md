Notes: Bred in 1974 and released in 1990, Centennial is genetically composed of Brewers Gold, Fuggle, Golding, and Bavarian varieties. It is often referred to as a 'Super Cascade' due to its strong citrus aroma and notably higher alpha acid content, which reflects a breeding trend towards enhancing desirable traits from established, popular varieties to provide brewers with more potent yet familiar options for hop-forward beers. Centennial is also recognized as one of the "Three Cs".

Brewing Usage:

Role: Classified as an aroma-type variety , Centennial is a versatile dual-purpose hop well-suited for bittering, offering a crisp and clean bitterness. Its robust character makes it ideal for single-hop beers and dry hopping applications.

Beer Styles: American Pale Ale, IPA.

Commercial Examples: Bell's Brewing Two Hearted Ale , Flying Dog Brewery Centennial Imperial IPA (as a single hop) , Sierra Nevada Bigfoot Ale , Sierra Nevada Celebration Ale. The use of Centennial in single-hop beers highlights its distinct character and commercial value in showcasing specific flavor profiles.

Substitution Suggestions: Cascade , Chinook , Columbus. For bittering, Columbus is a good substitute, while a 70/30 blend of Cascade and Columbus can approximate its aroma. Amarillo.

## Storage and Shelf Life

Hops are best stored in a cool (32-41°F or 0-5°C), dark, and oxygen-free environment to preserve their delicate aromas and alpha acids. Vacuum-sealed packaging or nitrogen-flushed bags are ideal. When stored properly, Centennial hops can maintain their quality for 3-5 years. Once opened, hops should be used quickly or re-sealed and stored as described above.

## Additional Context

Centennial is often considered a cornerstone of the American craft brewing movement, bridging the gap between traditional English hops and the more aggressive, fruit-forward varieties that emerged later. Its balanced profile of strong citrus and floral notes, combined with a clean bitterness, made it a favorite for defining the American IPA and Pale Ale styles. While newer hops have gained popularity, Centennial remains a reliable choice for brewers seeking a classic, assertive hop character without being overly one-dimensional. Its resilience and consistent performance have ensured its continued relevance in a rapidly evolving hop landscape.

## Usage and Considerations

When using Centennial, brewers should consider its potent citrus and floral notes. It performs exceptionally well in late boil additions, whirlpool, and dry hopping, where its aromatic compounds are best preserved. For bittering, it provides a clean and firm bitterness. Its versatility allows it to be used as a standalone hop or in combination with other varieties to build complex hop profiles. Brewers often pair it with other "C" hops (Cascade, Columbus) to create a layered hop character.
