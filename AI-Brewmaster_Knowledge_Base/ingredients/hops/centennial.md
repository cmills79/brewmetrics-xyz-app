# Hop Name: Centennial

## Technical Specifications

Country of Origin: USA (Washington, Oregon, Idaho)

Alpha Acids: 9.5-11.5%

Beta Acids: 3.5-4.5%

Cohumulone: 28-30%

Total Oil (ml/100g): 1.5-2.5

## Aroma/Flavor Descriptors

Primary: Citrus, Floral, Lemon

Secondary: Pine, Spicy, Clean Bitterness

## Notes

Centennial is often called "Super Cascade" due to its similar citrus character but higher alpha acid content. Developed in 1974 and released in 1990, it's one of the "Three Cs" (Cascade, Centennial, Columbus) that define American craft brewing. This hop provides excellent bittering capabilities while maintaining the classic American citrus and floral aroma profile. Its balanced oil content makes it versatile for both bittering and aroma applications.

## Brewing Usage

Role: Dual-purpose hop excellent for both bittering and aroma. Higher alpha acids than Cascade make it more efficient for bittering while maintaining similar aroma characteristics.

Beer Styles: American Pale Ale, IPA, American Wheat, American Amber Ale

## Commercial Examples

Bell's Two Hearted Ale, Founders All Day IPA, Sierra Nevada Celebration Ale

Substitution Suggestions: Cascade, Columbus, Amarillo, Chinook

## Storage and Shelf Life

Store in cool (32-41Â°F), dark, oxygen-free environment. Vacuum-sealed or nitrogen-flushed packaging preferred. Properly stored Centennial hops maintain quality for 3-5 years. Higher alpha acid content makes it more stable than some aroma-only varieties.

## Additional Context

Centennial bridges the gap between Cascade's moderate bittering and Columbus's high alpha content. It's particularly valued in American IPAs where brewers want citrus character with efficient bittering. The hop's clean bitterness doesn't clash with malt flavors, making it suitable for balanced pale ales as well as hop-forward styles.

## Usage and Considerations

Centennial works exceptionally well in late boil additions (5-20 minutes) where its citrus oils shine. For dry hopping, it provides bright citrus aroma without excessive grassiness. When used for bittering, it contributes clean, pleasant bitterness that doesn't dominate. Pairs excellently with other American hops, particularly Cascade and Columbus, creating layered citrus profiles.
