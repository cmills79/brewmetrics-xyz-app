## Flavor & Aroma Profile

Primary: Pine, Earthy, Grapefruit.

Secondary: Passionfruit, Berry, Resinous. It is often described as having a "dank" or "catty" aroma.

Notes: Simcoe is a proprietary hop variety released in 2000 by Yakima Chief Ranches. It quickly gained popularity for its unique and complex aroma profile, which combines prominent pine and earthy notes with subtle citrus and passionfruit undertones. Its high alpha acid content also makes it suitable for bittering, but its primary value lies in its aromatic contributions, particularly in hop-forward beer styles. Simcoe is often referred to as a "super hop" due to its versatility and intense flavor.

## Brewing Usage

Role: Dual-purpose hop, highly valued for late additions, whirlpool, and dry hopping to maximize its intense flavor and aroma contributions. Can also be used for bittering.

Beer Styles: American IPA, Pale Ale, Imperial IPA, NEIPA, Session IPA, American Wheat.

## Commercial Examples

Russian River Pliny the Elder, Stone IPA, Sierra Nevada Torpedo Extra IPA.

Substitution Suggestions: Mosaic, Citra, Chinook, Columbus.

## Storage and Shelf Life

Hops are best stored in a cool (32-41°F or 0-5°C), dark, and oxygen-free environment to preserve their delicate aromas and alpha acids. Vacuum-sealed packaging or nitrogen-flushed bags are ideal. When stored properly, Simcoe hops can maintain their quality for 3-5 years. Once opened, hops should be used quickly or re-sealed and stored as described above.

## Additional Context

Simcoe's rise to prominence was instrumental in shaping the modern American IPA style. Its distinctive "piney" and "dank" character, combined with itssubtle fruit notes, made it a favorite for brewers looking to create complex and layered hop characters. It performs exceptionally well in modern hop-forward beers, contributing to both aroma and flavor. Its relatively high cohumulone content, while making it suitable for bittering, doesn't detract from its primary use as an aroma hop. Simcoe is often used as a cornerstone hop in many modern IPAs, either as a standalone hop or in combination with other complementary varieties like Citra and Mosaic.

## Usage and Considerations

When using Simcoe, brewers should leverage its potent aromatic qualities. It excels in late boil additions (10-0 minutes), whirlpool, and especially dry hopping, where its volatile oils are best preserved. For bittering, it provides a clean bitterness, but its unique aroma often reserves it for flavor and aroma contributions. Brewers often pair Simcoe with other tropical or citrus-forward hops to create complex fruit bomb profiles, or with danker hops to add another layer of complexity. Its versatility allows it to be the star of a single-hop IPA or a key player in a multi-hop blend.
