Notes: Simcoe has become one of the most popular hops for brewing. It is often described as "Cascade on steroids" due to its intense tropical fruit flavors, a description that reflects a broader trend in hop breeding to amplify successful flavor profiles for more intense, modern beer styles, catering to the evolving palate of craft beer consumers. Simcoe's consistent high ranking in U.S. hop production, reaching #4 in 2022, demonstrates that commercial brewers value its distinct character for product differentiation and its strong performance as a dual-purpose hop, even with its unique piney and sometimes "catty" notes.
