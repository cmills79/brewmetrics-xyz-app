## Notes

Mosaic is a proprietary hop variety released in 2012 by Hop Breeding Company (a joint venture between John I. Haas and Select Botanicals Group). It is a daughter of Simcoe and a Nugget-derived male. Mosaic quickly became one of the most sought-after hops in the craft brewing industry due to its complex and multifaceted aroma profile, which lives up to its name by offering a "mosaic" of flavors. Its unique combination of tropical fruit, berry, and citrus notes, often with an underlying pine or earthy character, makes it incredibly versatile and a favorite for hop-forward beer styles.

## Brewing Usage

Role: Dual-purpose hop, highly valued for late additions, whirlpool, and dry hopping to maximize its intense flavor and aroma contributions. Can also be used for bittering.

Beer Styles: American IPA, Hazy IPA, Pale Ale, NEIPA, Session IPA, American Wheat, Blonde Ale.

## Commercial Examples

Lagunitas Sumpin' Easy Ale, Stone Go To IPA, Deschutes Fresh Haze IPA.

Substitution Suggestions: Citra, Galaxy, Simcoe, Idaho 7.

## Storage and Shelf Life

Hops are best stored in a cool (32-41°F or 0-5°C), dark, and oxygen-free environment to preserve their delicate aromas and alpha acids. Vacuum-sealed packaging or nitrogen-flushed bags are ideal. When stored properly, Mosaic hops can maintain their quality for 3-5 years. Once opened, hops should be used quickly or re-sealed and stored as described above.

## Additional Context

Mosaic's rise to prominence has been meteoric, largely due to its ability to deliver a broad spectrum of desirable hop characteristics. It is often used as a cornerstone hop in many modern IPAs, either as a standalone hop or in combination with other complex and layered hop characters, contributing to the "juice" and aroma often associated with New England IPAs. Despite its relatively recent introduction, Mosaic has become an indispensable hop for brewers aiming to create vibrant, aromatic, and approachable hop-forward beers.

## Usage and Considerations

When using Mosaic, brewers should leverage its potent aromatic qualities. It excels in late boil additions (10-0 minutes), whirlpool, and especially dry hopping, where its volatile oils are best preserved. For bittering, it provides a clean bitterness, but its high cost and unique aroma often reserve it for flavor and aroma contributions. Brewers often pair Mosaic with other "fruit-forward" hops to create complex tropical and citrus profiles, or with "dank" hops to add another layer of complexity. Its versatility allows it to be the star of a single-hop IPA or a key player in a multi-hop blend complementary varieties like Citra and Galaxy. Its complex profile allows brewers to createa wide range of flavor experiences.
