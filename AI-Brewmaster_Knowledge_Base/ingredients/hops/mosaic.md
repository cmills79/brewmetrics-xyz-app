Notes: Developed by Hop Breeding Company and released in 2012, Mosaic is a daughter of Simcoe and a Nugget-derived male. It was named to reflect its "artistic assortment of aromas and flavors". In 2022, Mosaic, along with Citra, commanded nearly a third of the total hop acreage in the U.S., highlighting its significant market presence. The complex and diverse aroma profile of Mosaic contributes to its widespread commercial adoption, as it allows for versatility across many beer styles and also excels as a single-hop variety. This versatility enables brewers to achieve multiple desired outcomes—bitterness, flavor, and aroma—from a single hop, streamlining inventory and offering flexibility in recipe design. The frequent pairing of Mosaic with Citra in popular beers further illustrates a dominant flavor pairing trend in North American craft brewing, particularly for IPAs, where brewers actively seek synergistic hop combinations to create distinct and appealing flavor profiles.

Brewing Usage:

Role: Dual-purpose. It can be effectively used in all hop additions throughout the brewing process, though it is primarily valued for flavor and aroma contributions. It is often considered best when used on its own to showcase its unique profile.

Beer Styles: Pale Ale, IPA, Stout. Also suitable for Saisons  and Double IPAs. It is frequently found in IPAs and Pale Ales  and can be featured as a single hop.

Commercial Examples: Deschutes Brewing Fresh-Squeezed IPA , SweetWater Hatchery Mosaic IPA , Founders Mosaic Promise , Other Half Mosaic Dream , Trillium Mosaic Cutting Tiles (these last four are 100% Mosaic beers).

Substitution Suggestions: Citra , Simcoe , Nugget.

Additional Notes: Mosaic is one of the most widely used and recognizable hop varieties in the industry. It pairs well with Citra, Simcoe, El Dorado, Amarillo, Galaxy, and Azacca. Like Citra, Mosaic is available in lupulin powder form, including Cryo/LupuLN2, Lupomax, and Hopsteiner products, offering concentrated flavor and aroma for whirlpool or dry hop additions.
