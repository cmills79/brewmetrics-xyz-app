## Notes

Citra is a relatively new hop variety, released in 2007, that quickly rose to prominence in the craft brewing world. It is a proprietary hop developed by Hop Breeding Company (a joint venture between John I. Haas and Select Botanicals Group). Its unique and intense aroma profile, dominated by strong citrus and tropical fruit notes, made it an instant favorite for brewers creating hop-forward beers. Citra's impact on the craft beer scene is significant, often credited with helping to define the modern American IPA and Pale Ale styles. Its high alpha acid content also makes it suitable for bittering, though its primary value lies in its aromatic contributions.

## Brewing Usage

Role: Primarily an aroma hop, highly valued for late additions, whirlpool, and dry hopping to maximize its intense flavor and aroma contributions. Can also be used for bittering.

Beer Styles: American IPA, Pale Ale, NEIPA (New England IPA), Session IPA, Wheat Beer, Blonde Ale.

## Commercial Examples

Sierra Nevada Hazy Little Thing IPA, Deschutes Fresh Squeezed IPA, Bell's Official Hazy IPA.

Substitution Suggestions: Mosaic, Galaxy, Amarillo, Simcoe (for some citrus/pine notes).

## Storage and Shelf Life

Hops are best stored in a cool (32-41°F or 0-5°C), dark, and oxygen-free environment to preserve their delicate aromas and alpha acids. Vacuum-sealed packaging or nitrogen-flushed bags are ideal. When stored properly, Citra hops can maintain their quality for 3-5 years. Once opened, hops should be used quickly or re-sealed and stored as described above.

## Additional Context

Citra's explosive popularity is a testament to its distinctive and highly sought-after flavor profile. It is often used as a cornerstone hop in many modern IPAs, either as a standalone hop or in combination with other complementary varieties like Mosaic and Galaxy. Its ability to impart a vibrant burst of citrus and tropical fruit has made it indispensable for brewers aiming to create juicy, aromatic, and approachable hop-forward beers. Despite its relatively recent introduction, Citra has become one of the most widely grown and utilized hop varieties globally.

## Usage and Considerations

When using Citra, brewers should leverage its potent aromatic qualities. It excels in late boil additions (10-0 minutes), whirlpool additions, and especially dry hopping, where its volatile oils are best preserved. For bittering, it provides a clean bitterness, but its high cost and unique aroma often reserve it for flavor and aroma contributions. Brewers often pair Citra with other "fruit-forward" hops to create complex tropical and citrus profiles, or with "dank" hops to add another layer of complexity. Its versatility allows it to be the star of a single-hop IPA or a key player in a multi-hop blend.
