## Notes

Citra is one of the most sought-after hops in craft brewing, developed by Hop Breeding Company and released in 2008. Its intense tropical fruit and citrus character has made it a cornerstone of modern American IPAs. The hop's high oil content and unique terpene profile create complex fruit flavors that range from grapefruit to tropical fruits like passion fruit and lychee.

## Brewing Usage

Role: Primarily aroma and flavor hop, though high alpha acids make it suitable for late bittering additions.

## Commercial Examples

Russian River Blind Pig IPA, Surly Furious, Bell's Two Hearted Ale, Dogfish Head 60 Minute IPA

Substitution Suggestions: Mosaic, Amarillo, Simcoe, Galaxy

## Storage and Shelf Life

Extremely hop oil-rich variety requires careful storage. Keep at 32-35Â°F in vacuum-sealed or nitrogen-flushed packaging. High oil content makes it more susceptible to degradation. Use within 2-3 years for best aroma impact.

## Additional Context

Citra's popularity has made it one of the most expensive and sought-after hops. Its intense aroma means a little goes a long way - often 0.5-1 oz per 5 gallons is sufficient for dry hopping. The hop works exceptionally well in combination with other citrus hops like Centennial and Cascade, or tropical hops like Mosaic and Galaxy.

## Usage and Considerations

Best used in late boil additions (0-20 minutes) and dry hopping to preserve volatile oils. For dry hopping, add during active fermentation for biotransformation effects. Can be overpowering if used excessively - start with smaller amounts and adjust. Pairs excellently with pale malts that won't compete with its intense fruit character.
