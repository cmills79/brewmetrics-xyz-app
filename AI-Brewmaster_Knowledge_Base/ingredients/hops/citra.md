Notes: Citra is a trademarked and patented aroma hop released in 2009 by the Hop Breeding Company. Its development was notably funded by major breweries including Sierra Nevada, Deschutes, and Widmer Brothers, indicating a direct industry response to a demand for specific hop characteristics. It boasts a very high total oil content, approximately double that of Cascade. Citra's rise has been exceptionally swift, becoming the fastest-growing U.S. hop between 2014 and 2019 and surpassing Cascade as the most grown hop variety in 2018. In 2022, Citra, alongside Mosaic, commanded nearly a third of total hop acreage, solidifying its dominant position in the market. This rapid ascent and continued market leadership underscore a significant shift in consumer preference towards bold, tropical, and citrus-forward hop profiles in North American craft beer. The potent citrus and tropical fruit character of Citra has been instrumental in revolutionizing IPAs. However, its high demand can present challenges for commercial breweries in securing consistent lots [User Query].

Brewing Usage:

Role: Primarily Aroma and Whirlpool/Dry Hop [User Query]. While its high alpha acid content allows for bittering, this is often considered a suboptimal use given its potent aromatic potential. It functions effectively as a dual-purpose hop.

Beer Styles: American IPA, Hazy/New England IPA, Pale Ale, American Amber Ale [User Query]. Also prominent in Double IPAs. It is often featured as a single hop to highlight its unique flavors and aromas.

Commercial Examples: Three Floyds Zombie Dust , Sierra Nevada Torpedo IPA [User Query], Toppling Goliath Pseudo Sue , Hill Farmstead Citra Single Hop Pale Ale , Verdant Fruit Car Sight Exhibition.

Substitution Suggestions: Mosaic , Simcoe , Galaxy (for tropical fruit notes) [User Query], Centennial (for citrus notes) , Cascade.

Additional Notes: Citra is one of the most sought-after aroma hops in the craft beer industry [User Query]. It pairs exceptionally well with Mosaic, Galaxy, and El Dorado. Citra is available in lupulin powder form, including Cryo/LupuLN2, Lupomax, and Hopsteiner products, which are concentrated lupulin powders designed for intense flavor and aroma in whirlpool or dry hop additions.
