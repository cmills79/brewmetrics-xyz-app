## Notes

Idaho 7 is a relatively new hop variety, released in 2015, developed by Jackson Hop Farm in Idaho. It quickly gained popularity in the craft brewing scene for its unique and complex aroma profile, which combines prominent tropical and citrus fruit notes with an underlying resinous and pine character. Its high alpha acid content also makes it suitable for bittering, but its primary value lies in its aromatic contributions, particularly in hop-forward beer styles. Idaho 7 is often described as a "multi-purpose" hop due to its ability to contribute across the flavor spectrum.

## Brewing Usage

Role: Dual-purpose hop, excellent for late additions, whirlpool, and dry hopping to maximize its intense flavor and aroma contributions. Can also be used for bittering.

Beer Styles: American IPA, Hazy IPA, Pale Ale, NEIPA, Session IPA, American Wheat.

## Commercial Examples

Deschutes Squeezy Rider IPA, Sierra Nevada Hazy Little Thing IPA (often blended), Stone IPA (often blended).

Substitution Suggestions: Mosaic, Citra, Galaxy, El Dorado.

## Storage and Shelf Life

Hops are best stored in a cool (32-41°F or 0-5°C), dark, and oxygen-free environment to preserve their delicate aromas and alpha acids. Vacuum-sealed packaging or nitrogen-flushed bags are ideal. When stored properly, Idaho 7 hops can maintain their quality for 3-5 years. Once opened, hops should be used quickly or re-sealed and stored as described above.

## Additional Context

Idaho 7 has carved out a significant niche in the craft brewing world due to its distinctive and versatile flavor profile. Its ability to deliver a punch of tropical fruit and citrus while also offering a subtle pine and resinous backbone makes it a favorite for brewers looking to create complex and layered hop characters. It performs exceptionally well in modern hop-forward beers, contributing to both aroma and flavor. Its relatively high cohumulone content, while making it suitable for bittering, doesn't detract from its primary use as an aroma hop.

## Usage and Considerations

When using Idaho 7, brewers should leverage its potent aromatic qualities. It excels in late boil additions (10-0 minutes), whirlpool, and especially dry hopping, where its volatile oils are best preserved. For bittering, it provides a clean bitterness, but its unique aroma often reserves it for flavor and aroma contributions. Brewers often pair Idaho 7 with other tropical or citrus-forward hops to create complex fruit bomb profiles, or with danker hops to add another layer of complexity. Its versatility allows it to be the star of a single-hop IPA or a key player in a multi-hop blend.
