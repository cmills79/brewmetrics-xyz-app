Notes: Idaho 7, also known as J-007, was developed by Jackson Hop Farm in Wilder, Idaho, and first released in 2015. Its rapid ascent to tenth place in hop acreage in its first year of widespread commercial production (1,509 acres) demonstrates the intense demand for new, distinctive aroma profiles in the North American craft beer market and the industry's agility in adopting them. The combination of "tropical fruit" and "resiny pine" in Idaho 7's profile exemplifies a trend towards complex, multi-layered hop aromas that bridge traditional West Coast (pine) and modern Hazy IPA (tropical) characteristics, appealing to a broad spectrum of craft beer consumers.

Brewing Usage:
