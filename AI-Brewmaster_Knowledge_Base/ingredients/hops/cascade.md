## Notes

Cascade is a very successful and well-established American aroma hop, developed by the USDA-ARS breeding program in 1956 and released for cultivation in 1972. It is recognized as one of the "Three Cs" along with Centennial and Columbus, signifying its foundational status in American craft brewing. Its versatility has placed it at the top of the most popular hop varieties in the U.S. , and it is widely considered the most popular hop for American microbreweries. This enduring popularity, even with the emergence of more intense varieties like Citra and Mosaic, demonstrates its reliability, versatility, and classic American hop character, suggesting a continued demand for balanced and accessible hop profiles. The natural landscape and weather conditions in Oregon are particularly conducive to growing Cascade, highlighting the importance of terroir and regional agricultural suitability for large-scale commercial production.

## Brewing Usage

Role: Primarily an aroma hop. It offers a medium-strength aroma with balanced bittering potential , making it a dual-purpose hop. It is ideally used as a late hop addition to maximize its aromatic contributions.

Beer Styles: American Pale Ale, IPA, Porters , Lagers.

## Commercial Examples

Sierra Nevada Pale Ale, Deschutes Mirror Pond Pale Ale, Stone IPA.

## Storage and Shelf Life

Hops are best stored in a cool (32-41°F or 0-5°C), dark, and oxygen-free environment to preserve their delicate aromas and alpha acids. Vacuum-sealed packaging or nitrogen-flushed bags are ideal. When stored properly, Cascade hops can maintain their quality for 3-5 years. Once opened, hops should be used quickly or re-sealed and stored as described above.

## Additional Context

Cascade is often considered the quintessential American craft beer hop, largely due to its distinctive aroma and flavor profile that helped define the American Pale Ale style. Its widespread adoption by early craft brewers cemented its status as a foundational hop. While newer, more intense hop varieties have emerged, Cascade continues to be a staple, valued for its balanced characteristics and ability to provide a bright, refreshing citrus and floral note without being overly aggressive. Its moderate alpha acid content makes it suitable for both bittering and aroma additions, offering brewers flexibility in recipe design.

## Usage and Considerations

When using Cascade, brewers should consider its prominent grapefruit and floral notes. It performs exceptionally well in dry hopping and late boil additions, where its aromatic compounds are best preserved. For bittering, it provides a clean bitterness. Its versatility allows it to be used as a standalone hop or in combination with other varieties to build complex hop profiles. Brewers often pair it with other "C" hops (Centennial, Columbus) or with hops that complement its citrus character.
