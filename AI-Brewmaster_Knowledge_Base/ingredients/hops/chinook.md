## Notes

Chinook is a high alpha acid hop developed in 1985 from a cross between Petham Golding and a USDA male. It is primarily used as a bittering hop but also contributes a distinctive aroma. Its robust and somewhat aggressive character makes it a favorite in American-style ales, particularly IPAs, where its pine and grapefruit notes complement other hop varieties. Chinook's dual-purpose nature and strong flavor profile have cemented its place as a foundational hop in the craft brewing industry.

Beer Styles: American Pale Ale, IPA, Stout, Porter, Barleywine.

## Commercial Examples

Substitution Suggestions: Northern Brewer, Columbus, Nugget, Centennial.

## Storage and Shelf Life

Hops are best stored in a cool (32-41°F or 0-5°C), dark, and oxygen-free environment to preserve their delicate aromas and alpha acids. Vacuum-sealed packaging or nitrogen-flushed bags are ideal. When stored properly, Chinook hops can maintain their quality for 3-5 years. Once opened, hops should be used quickly or re-sealed and stored as described above.

## Additional Context

Chinook is a classic American hop that has been a cornerstone of the craft brewing movement for decades. Its strong, assertive character makes it a popular choice for brewers looking to impart a bold bitterness and a distinctive piney, citrusy aroma. While newer, more exotic hop varieties have emerged, Chinook remains a reliable and versatile hop that continues to be widely used in a variety of beer styles. Its ability to provide both bittering and aroma contributions makes it a valuable asset in any brewer's arsenal.

## Usage and Considerations

When using Chinook, brewers should consider its potent pine and grapefruit notes. It performs exceptionally well in late boil additions and dry hopping, where its aromatic compounds are best preserved. For bitter ing, it provides a clean and firm bitterness. Its versatility allows it to be used as a standalone hop or in combination with other varieties to build complex hop profiles. Brewers often pair it with other "C" hops (Cascade, Centennial, Columbus) to create a layered hop character.
