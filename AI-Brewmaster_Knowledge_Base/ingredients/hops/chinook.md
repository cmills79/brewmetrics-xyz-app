Notes: Developed by the USDA breeding program in Washington State and released in 1985, Chinook is a cross between Petham Golding and a USDA male. It was named after the Chinook Native American tribe. Originally introduced as a high alpha bittering variety, Chinook has more recently gained favor as a dual-purpose hop in the craft brewing community due to its distinctive spice and pine aroma characteristics. This evolution reflects a broader shift in brewing preferences, where brewers seek more complex hop contributions beyond mere bitterness, even from traditionally high-alpha strains. Its robust and dependable nature has made it a favored choice among both homebrewers and commercial brewers. The strong "piney" and "resinous" character of Chinook has solidified its role as a key component in classic West Coast IPAs, significantly influencing the regional style identity within North American brewing.

Brewing Usage:

Role: Dual-purpose. It is an excellent bittering hop, providing a clean and economical bitterness due to its high alpha acid content. It can also be used in smaller quantities to add depth and complexity to various beer styles.

Beer Styles: IPA, American Pale Ale, Stout, Porter. It is also well-suited for darker beers.

Commercial Examples: Two Roses Brewery Chinook Pale Ale (single hop) , Stone's Arrogant Bastard (reportedly solely Chinook) , BrewDog's Punk IPA (used with other hops).

Substitution Suggestions: Nugget , Columbus , Galena (for bittering) , Northern Brewer (US) , CTZ , Tomahawk , Zeus. Sticklebract is noted as an aroma substitute, though its availability may be limited.
