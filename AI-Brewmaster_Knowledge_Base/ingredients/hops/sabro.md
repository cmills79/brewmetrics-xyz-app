## Notes

Sabro is a proprietary hop variety released in 2018 by Hop Breeding Company (a joint venture between John I. Haas and Select Botanicals Group). It is unique among hop varieties due to its complex and highly distinctive aroma profile, which often includes notes of coconut, cream, and cedar, alongside more traditional tropical and citrus fruit characteristics. This unusual combination makes Sabro a polarizing yet highly sought-after hop for brewers looking to create truly unique and innovative beer styles. Its high alpha acid content also makes it suitable for bittering, but its primary value lies in its aromatic contributions.

## Brewing Usage

Role: Primarily an aroma hop, highly valued for late additions, whirlpool, and dry hopping to maximize its intense and unique flavor and aroma contributions. Can also be used for bittering.

Beer Styles: NEIPA (New England IPA), Hazy IPA, American IPA, Pale Ale, Milk Stout, Fruited Sours.

## Commercial Examples

Sierra Nevada Hazy Little Thing IPA (often blended), Stone Hazy IPA (often blended), various craft breweries experimenting with unique hop profiles.

Substitution Suggestions: None truly capture its unique profile; however, some brewers might blend hops like Citra (for tropical), Mosaic (for complexity), or even small amounts of experimental hops to approximate certain facets.

## Storage and Shelf Life

Hops are best stored in a cool (32-41°F or 0-5°C), dark, and oxygen-free environment to preserve their delicate aromas and alpha acids. Vacuum-sealed packaging or nitrogen-flushed bags are ideal. When stored properly, Sabro hops can maintain their quality for 3-5 years. Once opened, hops should be used quickly or re-sealed and stored as described above.

## Additional Context

Sabro represents a new frontier in hop breeding, pushing the boundaries of what brewers and consumers expect from hop aroma. Its distinct coconut and creamy notes are particularly unusual and have led to its use in innovative beer styles,including those that aim to mimic cocktails or desserts. While its unique profile can be challenging to integrate, when used skillfully, Sabro can add an unparalleled layer of complexity and intrigue to a beer. Its relatively recent introduction means brewers are still exploring its full potential and best applications.

## Usage and Considerations

When using Sabro, brewers should be mindful of its potent and distinctive aroma. It excels in late boil additions (10-0 minutes), whirlpool, and especially dry hopping, where its volatile oils are best preserved. For bittering, it provides a clean bitterness, but its unique and often polarizing aroma often reserves it for flavor and aroma contributions. Brewers often pair Sabro with other tropical or citrus-forward hops to create complex fruit bomb profiles, or use it as a standalone hop to highlight its unique characteristics. Its strong character means a little can go a long way, and careful dosage is key to achieving the desired effect without overwhelming the beer.
