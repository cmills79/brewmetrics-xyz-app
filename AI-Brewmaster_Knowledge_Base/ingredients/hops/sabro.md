Notes: Sabro, formerly known as HBC 438, was released by the Hop Breeding Company in 2018. It is the result of a unique cross-pollination of a female Neomexicanus hop. Sabro's complex, multifaceted flavor profile has earned it a reputation as a "chameleon" in the beer industry. In 2019, Sabro was the 20th highest in total production in the U.S., with over 1.1 million pounds harvested, indicating its rapid commercial acceptance. This hop is strongly expressive, translating its flavor exceptionally well into beer. Its unique profile, particularly the coconut note, offers a distinct tasting adventure that has been eagerly embraced by brewers and consumers alike.

Brewing Usage:

Role: Primarily an aroma hop, typically used in late boil additions, including dry hopping. Its multifaceted bouquet and high level of aromatic oils (particularly myrcene) make it excel in finishing and dry hop applications. It is considered a dual-purpose hop due to its moderately-high alpha acids.

Beer Styles: IPA, Pale Ale, Fruit Beer, Porter, Stout. It truly shines in IPA styles, where its tropical, fruity notes and touch of coconut are game-changers.

Commercial Examples: Example Brewery's Hazy IPA (where Sabro hops take center stage).

Substitution Suggestions: Citra (for tropical fruit character) , HBC 472 (for similar coconut and woody nuances) , Mosaic , Strata, Ekuanot (as pairings). A blend of 1/2 Summit and 1/2 Ekuanot is also suggested.

Additional Notes: Sabro is primarily grown in Washington state. It is available in lupulin powder form (Cryo/LupuLN2, Lupomax, Hopsteiner products), which is recommended for intense flavor and aroma in whirlpool or dry hop additions.
