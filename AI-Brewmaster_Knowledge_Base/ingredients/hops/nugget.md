Total Oil (ml/100g): 1.8-2.5

## Aroma/Flavor Descriptors

Primary: Herbal, Spicy, Resinous.

## Notes

Nugget is a high alpha acid hop variety developed in 1970 from a cross between Brewer's Gold and a high alpha acid male. It is primarily used as a bittering hop due to its high alpha acid content and relatively clean bitterness. While primarily a bittering hop, Nugget can also contribute a pleasant, albeit subtle, herbal and spicy aroma, with hints of pine and grapefruit. Its versatility and consistent performance have made it a workhorse hop in the brewing industry for decades.

## Brewing Usage

Role: Primarily a bittering hop, but can also contribute subtle aroma and flavor if used in late additions.

Beer Styles: American Pale Ale, IPA, Stout, Porter, Barleywine, Lagers.

## Commercial Examples

Widely used as a bittering hop in many commercial beers, often without being highlighted due to its primary bittering role. Examples include various American ales and lagers.

Substitution Suggestions: Chinook, Columbus, Northern Brewer, Magnum.

## Storage and Shelf Life

Hops are best stored in a cool (32-41°F or 0-5°C), dark, and oxygen-free environment to preserve their delicate aromas and alpha acids. Vacuum-sealed packaging or nitrogen-flushed bags are ideal. When stored properly, Nugget hops can maintain their quality for 3-5 years. Once opened, hops should be used quickly or re-sealed and stored as described above.

## Additional Context

Nugget is a classic American hop that has been a reliable choice for brewers for many years. Its high alpha acid content makes it an efficient and cost-effective bittering agent, while its relatively low cohumulone content contributes to a smooth bitterness. Despite the emergence of newer, more aromatic hop varieties, Nugget remains a staple for brewers seeking a consistent and clean bittering foundation for their beers. Its subtle aromatic contributions can also add complexity to a beer without overpowering other flavors.

## Usage and Considerations

When using Nugget, brewers should primarily consider its high alpha acidcontent for bittering calculations. It is typically added early in the boil (60 minutes or more) to maximize alpha acid isomerization and achieve the desired bitterness level. While it can contribute subtle herbal, spicy, or pine notes if used in late additions, its main purpose is to provide a clean, foundational bitterness.
