Notes: Nugget is historically significant as one of the earliest "superalpha" hops, released by the USDA in 1981/1983. Its development marked a foundational shift in hop breeding towards higher alpha acid content, which was crucial for the emergence of the bitter, hop-forward styles that define American craft beer. It is a daughter of Brewers Gold  and has become a mainstay in many prominent American beer styles. Nugget exhibits good storage stability, retaining nearly 70% of its alpha acids after six months in storage , and offers excellent yield. Despite being primarily a bittering hop, its use for aroma and flavor by "highly respected breweries" and its inclusion in complex recipes demonstrate that even traditional bittering hops are being re-evaluated for their nuanced contributions to aroma, pushing the boundaries of hop utilization.
