Notes: Magnum (US) is primarily a bittering hop. It was released in 1993, with parentage including the American variety Galena and a German male hop. The cultivation of Magnum in the U.S. demonstrates its adaptability to American growing conditions. Magnum's role as a "clean bittering" hop with a low aroma impact signifies its importance for brewers who need to achieve high bitterness without introducing unwanted flavors, thereby allowing other hop additions or malt profiles to be more prominent. This represents a strategic choice for establishing a foundational bitterness in a beer. The fact that a "single hop IPA" can be brewed solely with Magnum (as seen with Mikkeller) suggests that even bittering hops can possess subtle, desirable aroma characteristics that can be amplified when used in large quantities, challenging the strict bittering/aroma dichotomy.

Brewing Usage:

Role: Primarily a bittering hop. It provides a strong and smooth bittering foundation, characterized by a clean bittering profile due to its low cohumulone content.

Beer Styles: Ale, Lager, Stout, Pale Ale, IPA. It is also suitable for Pilsners.

Commercial Examples: Sierra Nevada Torpedo Extra IPA (used as the sole bittering hop, alongside Citra and Crystal for aroma) , Mikkeller single hop IPA (reportedly solely Magnum, though difficult to obtain).

Substitution Suggestions: Galena , Magnum (GR) , Nugget , Columbus , Horizon , Northdown , Northern Brewer (US).
