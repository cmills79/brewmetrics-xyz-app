## Notes

US Magnum is a high alpha acid hop variety developed in the USA, primarily known for its clean and efficient bittering qualities. It is a descendant of the German Magnum variety, bred for similar characteristics but adapted to American growing conditions. Magnum is highly valued by brewers for its neutral bittering contribution, meaning it imparts bitterness without significant flavor or aroma, making it an excellent choice for a wide range of beer styles where a clean bitterness is desired without interfering with other hop or malt characteristics. Its low cohumulone content contributes to a smooth, less harsh bitterness.

## Brewing Usage

Role: Primarily a bittering hop. Its clean profile makes it ideal for providing a solid bitter base without contributing strong flavors or aromas.

Beer Styles: Lager, Pilsner, IPA, Pale Ale, Stout, Porter, Wheat Beer, Belgian Ales, or any style requiring clean bitterness.

## Commercial Examples

Widely used as a bittering hop in many commercial beers, often without being highlighted due to its neutral character. Examples include various lagers and IPAs where a clean bittering foundation is needed.

Substitution Suggestions: German Magnum, Horizon, Northern Brewer, Columbus (if a more aggressive bitterness is acceptable).

## Storage and Shelf Life

Hops are best stored in a cool (32-41°F or 0-5°C), dark, and oxygen-free environment to preserve their delicate aromas and alpha acids. Vacuum-sealed packaging or nitrogen-flushed bags are ideal. When stored properly, US Magnum hops can maintain their quality for 3-5 years, thanks to their good storage stability. Once opened, hops should be used quickly or re-sealed and stored as described above.

## Additional Context

US Magnum is a workhorse hop in the brewing industry, appreciated for its reliability and consistent performance. Its ability to provide a high level of clean bitterness makes it a cost-effective choice for brewers. While it doesn't offer the complex aroma profiles of many modern hop varieties, its neutrality is precisely its strength, allowing other ingredients to shine. It is often used as the sole bittering addition in beers where hop aroma and flavor are derived from other, more aromatic hop varieties added later in the brewing process.

## Usage and Considerations

When using US Magnum, brewers should primarily consider its high alpha acid content for bittering calculations. It is typically added early in the boil (60 minutes or more) to maximize alpha acid isomerization and achieve the desired bitterness level. Due to its neutral character, it can be used in large quantities for bittering without imparting undesirable flavors. While it can contribute subtle pine or resinous notes if used in late additions, its main purpose is to provide a clean, foundational bitterness.
