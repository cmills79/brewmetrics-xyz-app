Notes: Named after the Haitian god of agriculture , Azacca was bred by the American Dwarf Hop Association. It is characterized by a high myrcene fraction, contributing to its intense aromatic profile. Azacca's combination of high alpha acids and intense tropical and citrus aromas positions it as a prime example of modern dual-purpose hops that deliver both bitterness and a powerful flavor punch. This reflects a trend of brewers seeking efficiency and complexity from fewer hop additions in their recipes. The emphasis on "juicy mango" and "tropical fruits" along with its suitability for NEIPAs, underscores the continued dominance of the "hazy/juicy" trend in North American craft beer and the specific hop profiles required to achieve it.

Brewing Usage:
