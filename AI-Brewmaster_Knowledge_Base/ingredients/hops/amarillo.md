Notes: Amarillo is a popular American mid-range alpha acid variety, celebrated for its unique and distinct aroma. It was discovered growing "wild" (spontaneously) in a hop yard and subsequently developed by Virgil Gamache Farms. This origin story highlights the serendipitous nature of some hop innovation, contrasting with the deliberate breeding programs seen with other varieties. Amarillo is recognized as one of the top ten aroma varieties utilized by craft brewers. Its consistent pairing with other prominent hops like Citra, Mosaic, and Simcoe indicates its role as a versatile blending hop, contributing a reliable citrus base that complements more intense tropical or piney notes in complex recipes common in large-scale commercial brewing.

## Brewing Usage

Role: Primarily an aroma-type hop. It is highly valued for its contributions to flavor and aroma additions in beer.

Beer Styles: American-Style Ale, IPA.

## Pitch Rate Notes

Amarillo is versatile and can be used effectively in both single-hop and multi-hop brews. It is particularly favored in American-style ales and IPAs for its ability to impart a strong citrus character. When used in combination with other hops, it can enhance the overall complexity of the beer, providing a bright and refreshing citrus backbone that complements a variety of hop profiles.

## Additional Context

Amarillo's unique flavor profile and versatility make it a staple in many craft breweries. Its ability to blend well with other hops while still maintaining its distinct citrus character allows brewers to create a wide range of beer styles that appeal to diverse palates. The hop's moderate alpha acid content also makes it suitable for both bittering and aroma applications, providing flexibility in recipe formulation.

## Usage and Considerations

When using Amarillo, brewers should consider its strong citrus profile and how it interacts with other hops in the recipe. It is often used in late boil additions, whirlpool, and dry hopping to maximize its aromatic contributions. The hop's versatility allows it to be used in various beer styles, but it is particularly effective in beers that benefit from a pronounced citrus character. Brewers should also be mindful of the balance between Amarillo and other hops to ensure a harmonious flavor profile in the final product.
