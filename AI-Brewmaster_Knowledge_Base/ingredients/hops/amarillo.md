Notes: Amarillo is a popular American mid-range alpha acid variety, celebrated for its unique and distinct aroma. It was discovered growing "wild" (spontaneously) in a hop yard and subsequently developed by Virgil Gamache Farms. This origin story highlights the serendipitous nature of some hop innovation, contrasting with the deliberate breeding programs seen with other varieties. Amarillo is recognized as one of the top ten aroma varieties utilized by craft brewers. Its consistent pairing with other prominent hops like Citra, Mosaic, and Simcoe indicates its role as a versatile blending hop, contributing a reliable citrus base that complements more intense tropical or piney notes in complex recipes common in large-scale commercial brewing.
