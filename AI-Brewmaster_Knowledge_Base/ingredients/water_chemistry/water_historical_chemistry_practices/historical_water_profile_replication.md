# The Fallacy of Historical Replication: Beyond the City Name

A common mistake among brewers delving into water chemistry is the attempt to directly replicate the raw water profile of a famous brewing city, such as Burton, Plze≈à, or Dublin. This approach is flawed because it fails to account for two critical factors: historical brewing processes and historical water treatment. The water report for a city's municipal supply does not necessarily reflect the water that was actually used to brew its iconic beers.

## Historical Brewing Practices

Brewing practices have evolved significantly over the centuries. The water used in historical brewing was often untreated or minimally treated, relying on natural mineral content and local ingredients. Brewers of the past did not have access to modern water chemistry knowledge or treatment methods, which means that their brewing water profiles were shaped by the natural characteristics of their local water sources.

## The Myth of Direct Replication

Attempting to replicate a historical water profile by simply copying the ion concentrations from a city's water report ignores the complexities of how that water was used in brewing. The raw water profile is only part of the equation; the treatment methods and brewing practices of the time played a crucial role in shaping the final beer.
