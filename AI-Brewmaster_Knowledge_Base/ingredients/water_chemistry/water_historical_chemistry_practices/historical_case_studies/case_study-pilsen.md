# Case Study: Pilsen: The water of Plzeň, Czech Republic

**Profile Name:** Pilsen
**Source Location:** Plzeň, Czech Republic
**Description:** Pilsen water is famously soft, with extremely low concentrations of all mineral ions. This softness was key to producing the world's first pale lager, but historical brewers in the region unknowingly compensated for a critical deficiency in the water—its lack of calcium—through their process.

They employed decoction mashing, a method involving boiling a portion of the mash and returning it to the main vessel. This intense process helped to extract additional calcium and other minerals from the malt husks, providing enough of the crucial ion for proper enzyme function and yeast health.

**Target Ion Concentration (ppm):**

- **Calcium (Ca):** 5 - 10

- **Magnesium (Mg):** 1 - 3

- **Sodium (Na):** 1 - 3

- **Sulfate (SO4):** 5 - 10

- **Chloride (Cl):** 1 - 3

- **Bicarbonate (HCO3):** 20 - 30

**Sulfate to Chloride Ratio:** Not applicable due to low concentrations of both ions.

**Brewing Usage:**

- **Effect on Beer:** Produces a very light, crisp, and clean lager with a delicate malt character. The low mineral content allows the malt flavors to shine without interference from harsh mineral notes.

- **Recommended Styles:** Pilsner, Helles, Kölsch.

**Notes:**
Using a true Pilsen water profile with a single-infusion mash would likely lead to issues with poor yeast flocculation, haze, and potentially beer stone formation. This demonstrates that process and water chemistry are inextricably linked. Modern brewers should consider using calcium-rich salts or mashing techniques that mimic historical practices to achieve the desired beer quality.

This case study illustrates the historical significance of water chemistry in brewing, particularly in the development of the Pilsner style. The unique water profile of Plzeň, combined with traditional brewing methods, created a beer that has become a benchmark for lagers worldwide. Understanding these historical practices can inform modern brewing techniques and water treatment strategies, ensuring that brewers can replicate or innovate upon classic styles effectively.
