# Case Study: Dublin & London

**Profile Name:** Dublin & London
**Source Location:** Dublin and London, England
**Description:** The historical water profiles of Dublin and London were significantly influenced by the natural mineral content of their water sources. Dublin's water was soft, while London's was harder, leading to distinct brewing practices in each city.
**Target Ion Concentration (ppm):**

- **Calcium (Ca):** 50 - 100

- **Magnesium (Mg):** 10 - 30

- **Sodium (Na):** 10 - 20

- **Sulfate (SO4):** 50 - 100

- **Chloride (Cl):** 20 - 50

- **Bicarbonate (HCO3):** 100 - 200

**Sulfate to Chloride Ratio:** Balanced, with a slight preference for chloride in Dublin and sulfate in London.

**Brewing Usage:**

- **Effect on Beer:** Dublin's softer water profile allowed for the production of smooth, malt-forward beers, while London's harder water contributed to a more pronounced hop bitterness and dryness in their ales.

- **Recommended Styles:** Dublin: Irish Red Ale, Stout; London: English Bitter, Porter.

**Notes:**
The historical significance of these water profiles lies in their influence on the brewing traditions of each city. Dublin's soft water was ideal for brewing rich, malty stouts and ales, while London's harder water suited hop-forward styles.

This case study illustrates the importance of water chemistry in shaping the character of beers from different regions. The distinct mineral content of Dublin and London's water sources led to the development of unique brewing styles that are still celebrated today. Understanding these historical practices can inform modern brewers in their quest to replicate or innovate upon classic styles, ensuring that the legacy of these iconic brewing cities continues to thrive.

The high temporary hardness (bicarbonate) of the water in Dublin and London made these cities natural homes for dark beers like Stout and Porter.

This is because the high alkalinity of the water was well-suited to balancing the acidity of the roasted malts used in these styles. The brewers in these cities adapted their brewing techniques to work with their local water profiles, often treating the water by boiling it to precipitate out excess minerals and reduce alkalinity, thus making it more suitable for brewing.

The water's high alkalinity was perfect for buffering the acidity of the large quantities of roasted malts used in these styles. However, to assume the brewers simply used this water straight from the well or river is a historical oversimplification. Evidence suggests that brewers often treated their water, most commonly by boiling it prior to mashing.

This boiling process would precipitate out calcium carbonate as chalk, effectively softening the water and reducing its alkalinity. This treatment was crucial for brewing less intensely dark beers like Brown Ale, which required a more balanced pH for optimal fermentation and flavor development.

Boiling water with high temporary hardness causes calcium carbonate to precipitate out as chalk, effectively softening the water and reducing its alkalinity. This would have been particularly important for brewing less intensely dark beers like Brown Ale.

Furthermore, modern breweries like Guinness do not use Dublin's municipal water; they have their own private wells and employ modern water treatment, such as reverse osmosis, to create the soft water they require for their iconic dry stout. These examples underscore a critical lesson: historical water profiles are interesting as a starting point for understanding why a style developed, but they are not prescriptive templates for modern brewing.
