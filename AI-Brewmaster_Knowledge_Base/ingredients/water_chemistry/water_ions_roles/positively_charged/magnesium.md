# Magnesium (Mg2+)

While it contributes to water hardness similarly to calcium, magnesium's primary role is as a critical yeast nutrient.

Biochemical Role: Magnesium serves as a necessary cofactor for over 300 different enzymes within the yeast cell, making it essential for healthy metabolism, growth, and fermentation performance. It contributes to lowering mash pH, but its effect is less pronounced than calcium's because magnesium salts are more soluble.

Flavor and Target Concentration: In small amounts (10–30 ppm), magnesium is beneficial for yeast health. Malt itself typically contributes a sufficient baseline amount of magnesium for yeast nutrition, so direct additions are often made for flavor adjustment. At concentrations above 30–40 ppm, magnesium can impart a dry, astringent, or unpleasantly sour-bitter taste to the beer.
