# Bicarbonate (HCO3−)

Bicarbonate is the primary source of alkalinity in brewing water and is the most important ion for controlling mash pH.

Biochemical Role: As a weak base, bicarbonate neutralizes the natural acidity of malt, thereby raising the pH of the mash. The required level of bicarbonate is dictated entirely by the color of the beer being brewed. Pale beers, made from lightly kilned malts with low acidity, require very low bicarbonate levels to allow the mash pH to fall into the optimal range. Dark beers, which use highly kilned and roasted malts that are significantly more acidic, require higher levels of bicarbonate to buffer this acidity and prevent the mash pH from dropping too low.

Target Concentration: For pale lagers and pale ales, bicarbonate should ideally be below 50 ppm. For dark styles like porters and stouts, levels of 100–300 ppm are often necessary to achieve a balanced mash pH.
