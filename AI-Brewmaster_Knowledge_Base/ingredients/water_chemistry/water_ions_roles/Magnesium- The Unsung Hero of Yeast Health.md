# 4. Magnesium: The Unsung Hero of Yeast Health

While Calcium often takes the spotlight, Magnesium (Mg2+) plays a vital, albeit
 secondary, role in brewing.
Like calcium, it contributes to water hardness and helps to
 lower mash pH, though it is less effective.
Its most critical function, however, is as a key
 yeast nutrient.
Magnesium acts as a cofactor for several metabolic enzymes within the
 yeast cell, essentially helping the yeast to process sugars and perform a healthy.
efficient fermentation. For most all-malt beers, the grains themselves provide sufficient
 levels of magnesium (typically around 5-10 ppm) for the yeast to thrive.
It's rare to
 need to add magnesium salts. In fact, excessive levels (above 40 ppm) should be
 avoided, as they can contribute a sour, metallic, or astringent flavor to the finished
 beer.
Think of magnesium as a necessary background character-essential for the plot,
 but not the star of the show.
