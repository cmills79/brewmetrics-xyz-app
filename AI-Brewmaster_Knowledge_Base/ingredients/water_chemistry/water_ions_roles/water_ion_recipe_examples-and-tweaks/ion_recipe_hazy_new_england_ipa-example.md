# 12. Recipe Formula: Hazy New England IPA

This recipe aims to create a soft, juicy, and aromatic NEIPA.
The flavor profile is
 dominated by tropical and citrus hop notes with very low perceived bitterness.
The
 water chemistry, with its high chloride and low sulfate, is fundamental to achieving the
 characteristic pillowy mouthfeel.

Yeast:
Wyeast 1318 (London Ale III) or a similar high-ester, low-flocculating strain.
Process:

1. Build your water profile from RO water using primarily Calcium Chloride (CaCl2)
 and a smaller amount of Gypsum (CaSO4).
Sodium Chloride (NaCl) can also be
 used to help hit the sodium and chloride targets.
2. Mash in at $68^{circ}C$ (154°F). The higher mash temperature and the large percentage
 of oats and wheat contribute to a fuller body and stable haze.

3. Lauter carefully to avoid a stuck sparge due to the high adjunct load.
4. Boil for 60 minutes. Note the absence of a bittering hop addition.
All hops are
 added late to maximize flavor and aroma while minimizing IBU contribution.
5. Chill to 19°C (66°F) and pitch yeast.
6. Add the first dry hop charge during active fermentation to leverage
 biotransformation for unique fruity ester production.
7. Add the second dry hop charge after fermentation has completed.
8. Crash cool and package without fining or extensive filtration.
The high chloride
 level is key here, enhancing the perception of malt sweetness and creating the
 full, soft, pillowy mouthfeel that defines the style, allowing the expressive hop
 aromas to be the star.
