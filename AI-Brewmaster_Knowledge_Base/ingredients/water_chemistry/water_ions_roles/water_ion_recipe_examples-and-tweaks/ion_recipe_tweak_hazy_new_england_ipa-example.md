# 13. Recipe Tweaks for Hazy New England IPA

Proven Tweak: Push the Chloride to Sulfate ratio to 3:1 or even 4:1 (e.g.. 225 ppm Cl- to
 75 ppm SO42-).
This is a common practice for brewers looking to create an
 exceptionally soft, almost creamy mouthfeel.
This adjustment further suppresses any
 hint of hop bite and enhances the perception of a full, round body created by the oats
 and wheat.
It pushes the beer further away from a classic IPA and more into the "hop
 juice" category, making the fruity and tropical hop notes feel even more integrated and
 less sharp.
Theoretical Tweak: Experiment with adding a fruit puree, such as mango or
 passionfruit, late in fermentation.
The key water chemistry consideration here is the
 natural acidity of the fruit.
Before adding it, one would need to measure the pH of the
 puree.
The theoretical tweak would be to make a proactive, small addition of Sodium
 Bicarbonate (NaHCO3) to the beer just before adding the fruit.
The goal is not to raise
 the beer's pH significantly, but to provide a slight buffering capacity to counteract the
 fruit's acidity, which could otherwise make the beer overly tart and thin out the
 mouthfeel.
This pre-emptive buffering could help maintain the desired soft, full-bodied
 character of the NEIPA style, ensuring the fruit flavor integrates as a complementary
 "juicy" note rather than a sharp, acidic one.
