# 11. Recipe Tweaks for Classic West Coast IPA

Proven Tweak: Increase the Sulfate to Chloride ratio even further to 6:1 or 7:1 by
 raising sulfate to 300-350 ppm while keeping chloride at 50 ppm.
This is a common
 technique for "San Diego style" Pale Ales and IPAs.
The effect is an even drier, more
 mineral-like finish that makes the hop bitterness incredibly sharp and cutting.
This
 works best with very low finishing gravities and minimal crystal malt to avoid any
 competing sweetness, resulting in a beer that is aggressively hop-focused.
Theoretical Tweak: Introduce a small amount of Sodium Chloride (NaCl) to raise the
 sodium level to around 50-60 ppm while maintaining the high sulfate ratio.
The theory
 is that this small sodium addition could add a subtle roundness to the initial palate,
 making the aggressive hop character slightly more approachable without turning the
 beer "soft."
It's a delicate balance; too much sodium with high sulfate will result in a
 harsh, metallic clash.
However, a carefully measured dose might create a more complex
 mouthfeel, adding a layer of perceived body before the classic, sharp, sulfate-driven
 finish takes over.
This could be particularly interesting when using hops with more
 complex, savory notes alongside the classic citrus and pine.
