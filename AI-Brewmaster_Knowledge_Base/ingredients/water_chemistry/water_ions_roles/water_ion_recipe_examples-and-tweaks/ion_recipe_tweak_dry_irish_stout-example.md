# 15. Recipe Tweaks for Dry Irish Stout

Proven Tweak: Increase the chloride level to around 100-120 ppm while keeping
 sulfate low.
This is a subtle change that enhances the mouthfeel, making the stout feel
 fuller and rounder on the palate without increasing the finishing gravity.
It complements
 the creaminess from the flaked barley and nitrogen service, creating a richer sensory
 experience.
The bicarbonate level would remain high to continue buffering the roast
 acidity, but the shift in the chloride-sulfate balance tilts the perception towards a softer,
 more substantial body.
Theoretical Tweak: Incorporate a small percentage (2-3%) of Acidulated Malt into the
 grist while simultaneously increasing the bicarbonate level to around 250-275 ppm.
The theory here is to create a more complex acidic profile.
The Roasted Barley provides
 a sharp, coffee-like acidity, while the lactic acid from the Acidulated Malt would provide
 a softer, tangier background note.
The increased bicarbonate would be necessary to
 buffer this additional acid load, preventing the beer from becoming sour.
If balanced
 correctly, this could result in a stout with a brighter, more complex roast character and
 a cleaner finish, as the lactic acid helps to sharpen the flavor profile without adding
 astringency.
This is a high-risk, high-reward tweak that requires precise pH
 management.
