# 6. Shaping Flavor with Sulfate and Chloride

Once the mash and fermentation are complete, two ions rise to prominence in shaping
 the final sensory experience: Sulfate (SO42-) and Chloride (Cl-).
These ions act like
 seasoning, accentuating different aspects of the beer's flavor.
Sulfate is the brewer's
 tool for enhancing dryness and hop character.
It interacts with hop compounds to
 create a sharper, crisper, and more assertive bitterness.
This is why the classic pale ales

from Burton-on-Trent, England-a region famous for its high-sulfate water-were so
 renowned for their distinctively bitter bite.
In contrast, Chloride does the opposite. It
 enhances malt character, providing a sensation of fullness, sweetness, and a softer,
 rounder mouthfeel.
It brings forward the rich, bready, and caramel notes from the grain
 bill.
For this reason, chloride is favored in malt-forward styles like stouts, brown ales.
and, more recently, the soft and pillowy New England IPAS.
