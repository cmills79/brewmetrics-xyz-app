# Water Chemistry: Common Pitfalls and Troubleshooting

As with any complex technical process, water chemistry presents several common pitfalls for the unwary brewer.

The "Minerally" Off-Flavor: One of the most common errors is to create a beer with an unpleasantly harsh, "minerally," or salty character. This is almost always the result of excessively high Total Dissolved Solids (TDS). It often occurs when a brewer attempts to push both sulfate and chloride to high levels simultaneously, mistakenly believing this will enhance both hop and malt character. The result is a clash of ions that creates a muddled and harsh flavor profile. It is generally best to choose whether to emphasize hops or malt and adjust the water accordingly, rather than attempting to do both at once.

Trusting Software Blindly: Brewing software platforms like BeerSmith and Bru'n Water are indispensable tools for calculating salt additions and predicting mash pH. However, their pH predictions are, by necessity, estimates based on models of average malt acidity. The actual acidity of a specific batch of malt can vary. Therefore, it is crucial for brewers to verify the software's prediction by measuring the actual mash pH with a calibrated meter approximately 15 minutes into the mash. This allows for real-time adjustments with acid or alkali to ensure the mash hits its target pH, rather than simply hoping the initial calculation was correct.

Ignoring the Grist: It is essential to remember that the water profile must always be considered in the context of the grain bill. The required Residual Alkalinity is not a fixed target for a style, but a variable that depends entirely on the acidity of the malts being used. A stout made with 10% roasted barley will require a different (lower) bicarbonate level than a stout made with 20% roasted barley to achieve the same target mash pH. The brewer must understand this dynamic relationship and adjust the water to suit the recipe, not the other way around.
