# Volume and Temperature Calculation

Accurate water volumes and temperatures are critical for mashing efficiency and consistency.

Strike Water Volume Formula
Volume of Strike Water (L)=Total Grain Weight (kg)×Mash Thickness (L/kg)

Mash Thickness: A typical value is 2.5–3.5 L/kg.

Strike Water Temperature Formula
This formula, popularized by John Palmer, ensures the grain and water mixture reaches the target mash temperature.

Strike Water Temp (C)=
Mash Thickness
0.2×(Target Mash Temp)+(Grain Temp)
​
 +Target Mash Temp

Target Mash Temp (C): The desired temperature for the mash (e.g., 67°C for a Pale Ale).

Grain Temp (C): The ambient temperature of the grain.

Mash Thickness (L/kg): The water-to-grain ratio.

Practical Example

For a mash with 5 kg of grain at a target mash temperature of 67°C and an ambient grain temperature of 20°C, with a mash thickness of 3 L/kg:

Volume of Strike Water (L) = 5 kg × 3 L/kg = 15 L

Strike Water Temp (C) =

0.2 × (67°C) + (20°C) + 67°C

= 13.4 + 20 + 67 = 100.4°C

This means you would heat 15 L of water to approximately 100.4°C before adding it to the mash tun with the grain.

Sparge Water Volume Calculation

Sparge Water Volume Formula

Volume of Sparge Water (L)=
(Total Batch Volume (L)−Mash Water Volume (L))
Total Batch Volume (L): The total volume of wort desired in the kettle.
Mash Water Volume (L): The volume of water used in the mash.

Practical Example
For a total batch volume of 25 L and a mash water volume of 15 L:
Volume of Sparge Water (L) = 25 L − 15 L = 10 L
This means you would need 10 L of sparge water to achieve the desired batch size.
By mastering these calculations, brewers can ensure that they are using the correct volumes and temperatures of water, leading to more efficient mashing and sparging processes. This not only improves the extraction of sugars from the grain but also enhances the overall quality and consistency of the beer produced.
