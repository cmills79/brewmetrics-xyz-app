# Water Calculations: Mineral Salt Calculation

To adjust the water profile, brewers add specific mineral salts. The calculation for this is based on stoichiometry, converting the desired increase in ion concentration (in ppm or mg/L) into the required mass of the salt.

General Formula for Salt Addition
This formula can be adapted for any brewing salt.

Mass of Salt (g)=
(Molecular Weight of Ion)×(Number of Ions per Salt Molecule)
(Target ppm increase of ion)×(Water Volume in L)×(Molecular Weight of Salt)
​

Target ppm increase of ion: The desired change in concentration for a specific ion.

Water Volume in L: The total volume of water to be treated.

Molecular Weight of Salt: The total molecular weight of the mineral salt.

Molecular Weight of Ion: The atomic or molecular weight of the specific ion.
Number of Ions per Salt Molecule: The number of ions contributed by one molecule of the salt (e.g., 1 for calcium chloride, 2 for gypsum).
Practical Example
For example, to increase the sulfate concentration by 100 ppm in 20 L of water using gypsum (calcium sulfate, CaSO₄):
Mass of Gypsum (g)=
(Molecular Weight of Gypsum)×(Number of Ions per Salt Molecule)
(100 ppm)×(20 L)×(Molecular Weight of Gypsum)

Where:

- Molecular Weight of Gypsum (CaSO₄) = 172.17 g/mol

- Number of Ions per Salt Molecule = 1 (for sulfate)
- Water Volume in L = 20 L

This results in:
Mass of Gypsum (g)=
(172.17 g/mol)×(1)
(100 ppm)×(20 L)×(172.17 g/mol)
= 0.17217 g/mol × 100 ppm × 20 L = 34.43 g
Thus, to achieve a 100 ppm increase in sulfate concentration, you would need to add approximately 34.43 grams of gypsum to the 20 L of water.
This calculation can be repeated for other ions and salts, adjusting the molecular weights and number of ions as necessary.
