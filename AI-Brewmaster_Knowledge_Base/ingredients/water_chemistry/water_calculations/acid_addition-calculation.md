# Acid Addition Calculation

Acid Additions
To lower mash or sparge water pH, commercial brewers use food-grade acids. The exact amount required depends on the buffering capacity of the water and mash. This is often determined empirically or with sophisticated models.

Practical Rule-of-Thumb for pH Adjustment
For mash water with a typical grist (3 L/kg), a common rule of thumb for 88% Lactic Acid or 85% Phosphoric Acid is:
0.66 g (or 0.6 mL) of acid per kg of grist≈a pH reduction of 0.1 units

This is a simplified approach, and for large commercial batches, titration curves or advanced calculator models are used for precision. The calculator would use a model that considers the volume of water, its alkalinity (buffer capacity), and the pKa values of the acid being used.

To lower mash pH

1. **Determine the initial pH** of the mash water.

2. **Calculate the required pH reduction** based on the target pH (typically 5.2-5.6 for mashing).

3. **Use the rule of thumb** to estimate the amount of acid needed per kg of grist.

4. **Add the calculated amount of acid** to the mash water before mashing.

5. **Measure the final pH** after mixing and adjust further if necessary.

This method is efficient for large-scale operations, where precise control over pH is crucial for enzyme activity and overall fermentation performance.
