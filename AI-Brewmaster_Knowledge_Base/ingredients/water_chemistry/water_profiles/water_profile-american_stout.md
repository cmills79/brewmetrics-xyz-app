# Water Profile: American Stout

**Profile Name:** American Stout
**Source Location:** Engineered Profile
**Description:** This profile is engineered for the rich, dark, and robust character typical of American stouts. It features high bicarbonate levels to provide the necessary alkalinity for dark malts, enhancing chocolate and coffee flavors while maintaining a balanced bitterness.

**Target Ion Concentration (ppm):**

* **Calcium (Ca):** 100 - 180

* **Magnesium (Mg):** 5 - 15

* **Sodium (Na):** 30 - 60

* **Sulfate (SO4):** 50 - 90

* **Chloride (Cl):** 100 - 325

* **Bicarbonate (HCO3):** 100 - 200

**Sulfate to Chloride Ratio:** ~1:2 to 1:3.5 (Malt-forward)

**Brewing Usage:**

Effect on Beer: Significant bicarbonate provides alkalinity to counteract the acidity of roasted malts, preventing harsh, acrid flavors and promoting a smooth, rich character. High chloride enhances rich chocolate and coffee notes and contributes to a full, rounded body. Moderate sulfate supports a more prominent hop bitterness to balance the intense malt profile.

Recommended Styles: American Stout, Imperial Stout, Black IPA.

Caution: This high-alkalinity profile is purpose-built for dark beers. Using it for any pale beer would lead to an excessively high mash pH, extracting astringent tannins from grain husks. The precise amount of bicarbonate needed depends on the specific grist.

Notes: This profile is often used in conjunction with reverse osmosis (RO) water or distilled water to achieve the desired results. It is important to ensure that the water is properly treated to remove any residual chlorine or chloramine, which can negatively impact the flavor of the beer.

**Brewing Tips:**

* Always measure the actual mash pH and adjust as necessary, especially when using different malt bills.

* Consider adding a small amount of calcium sulfate (gypsum) or calcium chloride to fine-tune the flavor profile, but keep additions minimal to maintain the malt-forward character.

* If using RO water, remineralize carefully to avoid overshooting the target ion concentrations.

* This profile is particularly effective for brewers looking to create a rich, complex stout that showcases the malt character without interference from water chemistry.

**Additional Context:**

This water profile is a staple for many American stout brewers, providing a robust foundation that allows the dark malts to shine. It is particularly well-suited for large-scale brewing operations where consistency and malt expression are paramount. By adhering to this profile, brewers can produce stouts that are rich, flavorful, and true to style, appealing to a wide audience of beer drinkers.
This profile is also a great starting point for brewers experimenting with dark beer styles, as it provides a solid foundation that can be adjusted based on specific recipe needs or personal preferences. The high bicarbonate content allows for flexibility in brewing techniques, making it easier to achieve desired flavor outcomes without the interference of overly assertive water chemistry. It is particularly effective for brewers looking to create a rich, complex stout that showcases the malt character without interference from water chemistry.
This profile is also a great choice for those who enjoy experimenting with dark malt varieties and combinations, as the high bicarbonate content enhances the depth and complexity of the malt flavors used. The result is a beer that is not only flavorful but also has a smooth, drinkable character that appeals to a wide range of palates.
