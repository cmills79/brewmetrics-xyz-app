# Water Profile: American Lager

**Profile Name:** American Lager
**Source Location:** United States
**Style:** American Lager
**Description:** This water profile is characterized by its low mineral content, making it ideal for brewing light, crisp lagers. It is designed to highlight the clean fermentation character of lager yeast without overwhelming the palate with mineral flavors.

**Target Ion Concentration (ppm):**

* **Calcium (Ca):** 20 - 30

* **Magnesium (Mg):** 0 - 10

* **Sodium (Na):** 0 - 15

* **Sulfate (SO4):** 20 - 40

* **Chloride (Cl):** 20 - 40

* **Bicarbonate (HCO3):** 0 - 25

**Sulfate to Chloride Ratio:** 1:1 or lower

Brewing Usage:

Effect on Beer: The extremely low mineral content ensures a smooth, delicate, and highly drinkable beer with a clean, non-astringent finish. The balanced sulfate-to-chloride ratio prevents either the malt or the hops from becoming dominant, preserving the fragile harmony of the style. The near-zero bicarbonate level is essential for allowing the mash pH to drop into the correct range when using pale malts.

Recommended Styles: American Lager, American Light Lager, German Pilsner.

Caution: While lager yeast can perform adequately with low calcium, levels below 20 ppm may lead to challenges with yeast flocculation and beer clarity. This profile is entirely unsuitable for dark beers, as the lack of alkalinity would cause the mash pH to plummet, resulting in an overly acidic, thin-bodied beer.

Notes: This profile is often used in conjunction with reverse osmosis (RO) water or distilled water to achieve the desired low mineral content. It is important to ensure that the water is properly treated to remove any residual chlorine or chloramine, which can negatively impact the flavor of the beer.

**Brewing Tips:**

* Always measure the actual mash pH and adjust as necessary, especially when using different malt bills.

* Consider adding a small amount of calcium chloride or gypsum to fine-tune the flavor profile, but keep additions minimal to maintain the low mineral character.

* If using RO water, remineralize carefully to avoid overshooting the target ion concentrations.

* This profile is particularly effective for brewers looking to create a clean, refreshing lager that showcases the yeast and malt without interference from water chemistry.

**Additional Context:**

This water profile is a staple for many American lager brewers, providing a clean slate that allows the yeast and malt to shine. It is particularly well-suited for large-scale brewing operations where consistency and drinkability are paramount. By adhering to this profile, brewers can produce lagers that are approachable, refreshing, and true to style, appealing to a wide audience of beer drinkers.

This profile is also a great starting point for brewers experimenting with lager styles, as it provides a solid foundation that can be adjusted based on specific recipe needs or personal preferences. The low mineral content allows for flexibility in brewing techniques, making it easier to achieve desired flavor outcomes without the interference of overly assertive water chemistry.
