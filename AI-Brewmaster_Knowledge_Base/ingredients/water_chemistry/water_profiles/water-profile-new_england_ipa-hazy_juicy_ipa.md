# Water Profile: New England IPA (Hazy/Juicy IPA)

**Profile Name:** New England IPA (Hazy/Juicy IPA)
**Source Location:** Engineered Profile
**Description:** This profile is engineered for a soft, full-bodied mouthfeel and a juicy hop character typical of New England IPAs. It features high chloride levels to enhance sweetness and roundness while keeping sulfate low to avoid crispness.

**Target Ion Concentration (ppm):**

* **Calcium (Ca):** 100 - 150

* **Magnesium (Mg):** 5 - 20

* **Sodium (Na):** 10 - 50

* **Sulfate (SO4):** 75 - 10

* **Chloride (Cl):** 150 - 200

* **Bicarbonate (HCO3):** 0 - 50

**Sulfate to Chloride Ratio:** 1:2 to 1:3

**Brewing Usage:**

Effect on Beer: The high chloride concentration creates a full, soft, and almost silky mouthfeel that rounds out the palate, suppressing sharp bitterness and enhancing sweet, "juicy" hop flavors. Sulfate is kept low to avoid adding any crispness or dryness. High calcium remains important for yeast health.

Recommended Styles: New England IPA, Hazy IPA, Juicy IPA.

Caution: Exceeding 250 ppm of chloride can lead to a salty, briny, or medicinal flavor. Applying this profile to a crisp style like a West Coast IPA would result in a muted, sweet, and structurally unsound beer.

Notes: This profile is often used in conjunction with reverse osmosis (RO) water or distilled water to achieve the desired results. It is important to ensure that the water is properly treated to remove any residual chlorine or chloramine, which can negatively impact the flavor of the beer.

**Brewing Tips:**

* Always measure the actual mash pH and adjust as necessary, especially when using different malt bills.

* Consider adding a small amount of calcium sulfate (gypsum) to fine-tune the flavor profile, but keep additions minimal to maintain the soft character.

* If using RO water, remineralize carefully to avoid overshooting the target ion concentrations.

* This profile is particularly effective for brewers looking to create a soft, juicy IPA that showcases the hops without interference from water chemistry.

**Additional Context:**

This water profile is a staple for many New England IPA brewers, providing a soft canvas that allows the hops to shine. It is particularly well-suited for large-scale brewing operations where consistency and hop expression are paramount. By adhering to this profile, brewers can produce IPAs that are hazy, aromatic, and true to style, appealing to a wide audience of beer drinkers.
This profile is also a great starting point for brewers experimenting with hop-forward styles, as it provides a solid foundation that can be adjusted based on specific recipe needs or personal preferences. The high chloride content allows for flexibility in brewing techniques, making it easier to achieve desired flavor outcomes without the interference of overly assertive water chemistry. It is particularly effective for brewers looking to create a soft, juicy IPA that showcases the hops without interference from water chemistry.
This profile is also a great choice for those who enjoy experimenting with hop varieties and combinations, as the high chloride content enhances the aromatic qualities of the hops used. The result is a beer that is not only flavorful but also has a smooth, drinkable character that appeals to a wide range of palates.
