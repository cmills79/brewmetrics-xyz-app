# Water Profile: Burton-on-Trent

**Profile Name:** Burton-on-Trent
**Source Location:** Burton-on-Trent, England
**Description:** This water is famously hard and high in sulfates, which accentuates hop bitterness, making it crisp and dry. It is the historical basis for the classic English India Pale Ale style.

**Target Ion Concentration (ppm):**

* **Calcium (Ca):** 275 - 350
* **Magnesium (Mg):** 30 - 60
* **Sodium (Na):** 30 - 55
* **Sulfate (SO4):** 600 - 800
* **Chloride (Cl):** 35 - 50
* **Bicarbonate (HCO3):** 250 - 300

**Sulfate to Chloride Ratio:** ~10:1 or higher

**Brewing Usage:**

* **Effect on Beer:** Creates a sharp, crisp, "mineraly" hop bitterness. The high sulfate content can make the finish seem drier and enhances hop aroma. Not suitable for malt-focused styles as it will suppress malt character.
* **Recommended Styles:** English IPA, American IPA, English Pale Ale (Bitter).
* **Caution:** Using this profile for styles like Stouts, Porters, or Pilsners would result in a harsh, unpleasant bitterness.

**Notes:**
This profile is often used in conjunction with reverse osmosis (RO) water or distilled water to achieve the desired results. It is important to ensure that the water is properly treated to remove any residual chlorine or chloramine, which can negatively impact the flavor of the beer.

**Brewing Tips:**

* Always measure the actual mash pH and adjust as necessary, especially when using different malt bills.

* Consider adding a small amount of calcium chloride to fine-tune the flavor profile, but keep additions minimal to maintain the hop-forward character.

* If using RO water, remineralize carefully to avoid overshooting the target ion concentrations.

* This profile is particularly effective for brewers looking to create a crisp, hop-forward beer that showcases the hops without interference from water chemistry.

**Additional Context:**

This water profile is a staple for many brewers aiming to replicate the historical character of Burton-on-Trent ales. It is particularly well-suited for large-scale brewing operations where consistency and hop expression are paramount. By adhering to this profile, brewers can produce IPAs that are bold, aromatic, and true to style, appealing to a wide audience of beer drinkers.
This profile is also a great starting point for brewers experimenting with hop-forward styles, as it provides a solid foundation that can be adjusted based on specific recipe needs or personal preferences. The high sulfate content allows for flexibility in brewing techniques, making it easier to achieve desired flavor outcomes without the interference of overly assertive water chemistry. It is particularly effective for brewers looking to create a crisp, hop-forward beer that showcases the hops without interference from water chemistry.
This profile is also a great choice for those who enjoy experimenting with hop varieties and combinations, as the high sulfate content enhances the aromatic qualities of the hops used. The result is a beer that is not only flavorful but also has a clean, refreshing character that appeals to a wide range of palates.
