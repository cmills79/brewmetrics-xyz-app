# Water Profile: American Amber Ale

**Profile Name:** American Amber Ale
**Source Location:** Engineered Profile
**Description:** This profile is engineered to create a balanced and approachable amber ale with a moderate malt backbone and hop character. It features a balanced sulfate to chloride ratio, allowing both malt sweetness and hop bitterness to shine through without overpowering either.

**Target Ion Concentration (ppm):**

* **Calcium (Ca):** 50 - 100

* **Magnesium (Mg):** 10 - 20

* **Sodium (Na):** 10 - 40

* **Sulfate (SO4):** 75 - 150

* **Chloride (Cl):** 50 - 100

* **Bicarbonate (HCO3):** 50 - 100

**Sulfate to Chloride Ratio:** ~1:1 to 1.5:1 (Balanced to Slightly Bitter)

**Brewing Usage:**

Effect on Beer: This profile's moderate and balanced levels of sulfate and chloride allow both malt and hop character to be expressed clearly without one dominating the other. The moderate bicarbonate level provides sufficient buffering for the crystal and lightly toasted malts common in the style, helping to achieve a proper mash pH.

Effect on Hop:
Character: The moderate sulfate level enhances hop bitterness and aroma without making it overly sharp, while the chloride adds a touch of roundness to the overall flavor profile.

Recommended Styles: American Amber Ale, American Pale Ale, American Brown Ale.

Caution: While versatile, this balanced profile is not ideal for beers at the flavor extremes. It lacks the aggressive sulfate punch for a West Coast IPA and doesn't have the high chloride and alkalinity required for a rich American Stout or a soft New England IPA.

Notes: This profile is often used in conjunction with reverse osmosis (RO) water or distilled water to achieve the desired results. It is important to ensure that the water is properly treated to remove any residual chlorine or chloramine, which can negatively impact the flavor of the beer.

**Brewing Tips:**

* Always measure the actual mash pH and adjust as necessary, especially when using different malt bills.

* Consider adding a small amount of calcium sulfate (gypsum) or calcium chloride to fine-tune the flavor profile, but keep additions minimal to maintain the balanced character.

* If using RO water, remineralize carefully to avoid overshooting the target ion concentrations.

* This profile is particularly effective for brewers looking to create a balanced amber ale that showcases both malt and hop character without interference from water chemistry.

**Additional Context:**
This water profile is a staple for many American amber ale brewers, providing a solid foundation that allows the malt and hops to shine. It is particularly well-suited for large-scale brewing operations where consistency and balance are paramount. By adhering to this profile, brewers can produce amber ales that are approachable, flavorful, and true to style, appealing to a wide audience of beer drinkers.
This profile is also a great starting point for brewers experimenting with amber and pale ale styles, as it provides a solid foundation that can be adjusted based on specific recipe needs or personal preferences. The balanced mineral content allows for flexibility in brewing techniques, making it easier to achieve desired flavor outcomes without the interference of overly assertive water chemistry. It is particularly effective for brewers looking to create a balanced amber ale that showcases both malt and hop character without interference from water chemistry.
This profile is also a great choice for those who enjoy experimenting with different malt varieties and hop combinations, as the balanced mineral content enhances the complexity and depth of the beer. The result is a beer that is not only flavorful but also has a smooth, drinkable character that appeals to a wide range of palates.
