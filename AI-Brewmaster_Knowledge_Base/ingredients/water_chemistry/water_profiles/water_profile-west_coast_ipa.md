# Water Profile: West Coast IPA

**Profile Name:** West Coast IPA
**Source Location:** Engineered Profile
**Description:** This profile is engineered for a clean, crisp, and assertive hop-forward character typical of West Coast IPAs. It features high sulfate levels to enhance bitterness and hop expression while maintaining a balanced malt backbone.

**Target Ion Concentration (ppm):**

* **Calcium (Ca):** 100 - 150

* **Magnesium (Mg):** 10 - 30

* **Sodium (Na):** 0 - 50

* **Sulfate (SO4):** 250 - 400

* **Chloride (Cl):** 50 - 75

* **Bicarbonate (HCO3):** 0 - 50

* **Sulfate to Chloride Ratio:** 4:1 to 7:1

**Brewing Usage:**

* **Effect on Beer:** The extremely high concentration of sulfate produces a pronounced, clean, and assertive bitterness that is sharp but not harsh. High calcium ensures healthy fermentation and excellent clarity. A very low bicarbonate level is critical to prevent the high sulfate from creating an unpleasantly harsh, soapy bitterness.

* **Recommended Styles:** West Coast IPA, American IPA, Double IPA.

* **Caution:** This profile is unsuitable for malt-forward styles, as the high sulfate will overpower malt character. It will suppress malt character and create an aggressive, minerally bitterness in malt-focused beers. It is also not recommended for styles that require a more balanced or softer water profile. Pushing sulfate levels beyond 400 ppm risks creating a metallic, chalky, or astringent flavor.

**Notes:** This profile is often used in conjunction with reverse osmosis (RO) water or distilled water to achieve the
desired results.
It is important to ensure that the water is properly treated to remove any residual chlorine or chloramine, which can negatively impact the flavor of the beer.

**Brewing Tips:**

* Always measure the actual mash pH and adjust as necessary, especially when using different malt bills.

* Consider adding a small amount of calcium chloride to fine-tune the flavor profile, but keep additions minimal to maintain the hop-forward character.

* If using RO water, remineralize carefully to avoid overshooting the target ion concentrations.

* This profile is particularly effective for brewers looking to create a clean, refreshing IPA that showcases the hops without interference from water chemistry.

**Additional Context:**

This water profile is a staple for many West Coast IPA brewers, providing a clean slate that allows the hops to shine. It is particularly well-suited for large-scale brewing operations where consistency and hop expression are paramount. By adhering to this profile, brewers can produce IPAs that are bold, aromatic, and true to style, appealing to a wide audience of beer drinkers.
This profile is also a great starting point for brewers experimenting with hop-forward styles, as it provides a solid foundation that can be adjusted based on specific recipe needs or personal preferences. The high sulfate content allows for flexibility in brewing techniques, making it easier to achieve desired flavor outcomes without the interference of overly assertive water chemistry.
This profile is particularly effective for brewers looking to create a clean, refreshing IPA that showcases the hops without interference from water chemistry. It is also a great choice for those who enjoy experimenting with hop varieties and combinations, as the high sulfate content enhances the aromatic qualities of the hops used.
