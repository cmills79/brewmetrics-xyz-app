# Non-Iodized Salt (Sodium Chloride)

Brewing Salt: Non-Iodized Salt (Sodium Chloride)
Salt Name: Non-Iodized Salt / Canning Salt (Sodium Chloride)
Chemical Formula: NaCl
Description: Pure sodium chloride, free of iodine or anti-caking agents that could negatively impact beer. It is used to add sodium and chloride ions to brewing water, primarily to enhance mouthfeel and flavor complexity.

Ion Contribution per gram per U.S. gallon:

Sodium (Na
+
 ): 103.9 ppm

Chloride (Cl
âˆ’
 ): 159.3 ppm

Brewing Usage:

Effect on Beer: In small amounts, sodium chloride enhances malt sweetness and provides a roundness to the palate, similar to how salt enhances food flavors. It contributes chloride, which also promotes a fuller mouthfeel.

Primary Use: To subtly enhance flavor and mouthfeel, particularly in styles that benefit from a slight mineral character or in malt-forward beers where chloride is desired without adding more calcium.

Recommended Styles: Gose (where it is a defining ingredient), Stouts, Porters, and some historical English ales. Can be used in very small amounts in many styles to add a layer of flavor complexity.

Caution: Use sparingly. As concentrations approach 200 ppm, a distinct salty flavor becomes apparent. Iodine in iodized table salt is toxic to yeast and must be avoided.

Brewing Salt Addition Guidelines:

- **Mash Addition**: 0.5-1 gram per gallon of mash water to achieve a sodium level of 50-100 ppm, depending on the style and desired mouthfeel.

- **Kettle Addition**: 0.25-0.5 gram per gallon of wort to enhance flavor without overpowering.

- **Final Water Profile**: Aim for a sodium concentration of 50-100 ppm and chloride concentration of 50-100 ppm, depending on the desired flavor profile.

- **pH Adjustment**: Non-iodized salt does not significantly affect mash pH but can contribute to overall mineral balance.

- **Storage**: Store in a cool, dry place to prevent clumping. Non-iodized salt is stable and has a long shelf life.

- **Note**: Non-iodized salt is often used in homebrewing and smaller batches. In commercial brewing, it can be used to fine-tune water profiles, especially when building from reverse osmosis (RO) or distilled water where sodium and chloride levels are low.
