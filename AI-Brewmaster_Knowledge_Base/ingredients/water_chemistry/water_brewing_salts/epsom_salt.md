Description: A mineral salt used to add magnesium and sulfate ions to brewing water. While it contributes sulfate similar to gypsum, its primary brewing purpose is to supplement magnesium, which is a critical yeast nutrient.

Ion Contribution per gram per U.S. gallon:

Magnesium (Mg
2+
 ): 26.0 ppm

Sulfate (SO

 ): 102.7 ppm

Brewing Usage:

Effect on Beer: Magnesium is an essential cofactor for many yeast metabolic processes. In sufficient quantities (10-30 ppm), it ensures healthy fermentation. At higher concentrations (>50 ppm), it can contribute a sour or bitter flavor. The sulfate contribution will also slightly enhance hop sharpness.

Primary Use: To add magnesium to water that is deficient in it (like RO or distilled water) to ensure yeast health. It is a secondary choice for adding sulfates if calcium levels are already high.

Recommended Styles: Used in small amounts across many styles, particularly when building a water profile from scratch with RO water. It can be a part of historical English ale profiles.

Caution: Keep magnesium levels below 40-50 ppm. Higher levels can give the beer a laxative effect and contribute an unpleasant "minerally" bitterness.

Brewing Salt Addition Guidelines:

- **Mash Addition**: 0.5-1 gram per gallon of mash water to achieve a magnesium level of 10-30 ppm.

- **Kettle Addition**: 0.25-0.5 gram per gallon of wort to enhance yeast health and contribute to hop bitterness.

- **Final Water Profile**: Aim for a magnesium concentration of 10-30 ppm, depending on the yeast strain and desired fermentation characteristics.

- **pH Adjustment**: Epsom salt can also help lower the pH of the mash, making it useful in high-alkalinity water profiles, but its primary role is as a yeast nutrient rather than a pH adjuster.
