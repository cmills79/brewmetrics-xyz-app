Description: A salt highly soluble in water used to increase calcium and chloride concentrations. It is a fundamental tool for brewers looking to enhance malt character and create a softer, fuller mouthfeel in their beers.

Ion Contribution per gram per U.S. gallon:

Calcium (Ca
2+
 ): 72.0 ppm

Chloride (Cl
−
 ): 127.0 ppm

Brewing Usage:

Effect on Beer: Calcium chloride accentuates malt sweetness and complexity. The chloride ions contribute to a fuller, rounder, and softer mouthfeel, enhancing the perception of body without adding sweetness. It is a key salt for creating "soft" water profiles.

Primary Use: Increasing the chloride-to-sulfate ratio to favor malt-forward styles. A ratio of 2:1 or higher will enhance malt character and mouthfeel.

Recommended Styles: New England IPA (NEIPA), Brown Ales, Porters, Stouts, Scottish Ales, Barleywines, and any style where a rich malt profile and full body are desired.

Caution: Overuse can result in a salty or briny flavor in the final beer, which can clash with other flavors.

Brewing Salt Addition Guidelines:

- **Mash Addition**: 1-2 grams per gallon of mash water to achieve a chloride level of 100-200 ppm.

- **Kettle Addition**: 0.5-1 gram per gallon of wort to enhance malt character during the boil.

- **Final Water Profile**: Aim for a chloride concentration of 100-200 ppm, depending on the desired malt intensity and style.

- **pH Adjustment**: Calcium chloride can also help lower the pH of the mash, making it useful in high-alkalinity water profiles.
