# Baking Soda (Sodium Bicarbonate)

Brewing Salt: Baking Soda (Sodium Bicarbonate)
Salt Name: Baking Soda (Sodium Bicarbonate)
Chemical Formula: NaHCO
3
​
Description: An alkaline salt used to increase the sodium and bicarbonate levels in brewing water. Its primary function is to raise the pH of the mash, which is particularly useful when brewing dark beers with acidic roasted malts.

Ion Contribution per gram per U.S. gallon:

Sodium (Na
+
 ): 72.3 ppm

Bicarbonate (HCO
3
−
​
 ): 191.9 ppm

Brewing Usage:

Effect on Beer: Bicarbonate is a powerful buffer that counteracts the acidity of dark and roasted malts, preventing the mash pH from dropping too low. A proper mash pH is crucial for enzymatic activity and extracting the desired flavors. Sodium, in moderation, can round out flavors.

Primary Use: Raising mash pH and increasing Residual Alkalinity for dark, roasty beers.

Recommended Styles: Stouts, Porters, Schwarzbiers, and other dark lagers or ales where the grain bill is highly acidic.

Caution: Should not be used in pale or light-colored beers, as it will raise the mash pH too high, leading to the extraction of harsh tannins and a "soapy" flavor. High sodium levels (>150 ppm) can taste salty and clash with hop bitterness.

Brewing Salt Addition Guidelines:

- **Mash Addition**: 0.5-1 gram per gallon of mash water to achieve a bicarbonate level of 100-200 ppm, depending on the grain bill and desired pH.

- **Kettle Addition**: Not typically added to the kettle, as its primary role is in the mash.

- **Final Water Profile**: Aim for a bicarbonate concentration of 100-200 ppm, depending on the style and grain bill.

- **pH Adjustment**: Baking soda is effective for raising the pH of the mash, especially in high-alkalinity water profiles. It should be used cautiously to avoid overshooting the desired pH range.

- **Storage**: Store in a cool, dry place to prevent clumping and maintain effectiveness.

- **Note**: Baking soda is often used in homebrewing and smaller batches, but commercial brewers may prefer more precise pH adjustment methods like food-grade phosphoric acid or lactic acid to avoid the potential for off-flavors associated with high sodium levels.
