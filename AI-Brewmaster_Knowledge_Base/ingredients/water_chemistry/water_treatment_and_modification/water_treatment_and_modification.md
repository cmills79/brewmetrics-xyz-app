# Commercial Water Treatment and Modification

In a commercial brewery, achieving the desired water profile is a systematic, multi-step process that transforms variable source water into a consistent, high-quality brewing liquor. This process relies on a combination of analysis, purification, and precise additions of minerals and acids.

Step 1: Analysis of Source Water
The foundational step in any water treatment plan is to understand the starting point. A comprehensive water analysis from the local municipality or a specialized laboratory (such as Ward Labs) is non-negotiable. This report provides the baseline concentrations in parts per million (ppm) for the six principal brewing ions (

 ) as well as pH, total hardness, and total alkalinity. This data is the input for all subsequent calculations and adjustments.

Step 2: Purification via Reverse Osmosis (RO)
For the ultimate in control and consistency, many modern American breweries utilize reverse osmosis (RO) systems. An RO system uses high pressure to force water through a semi-permeable membrane that removes 99% or more of all dissolved minerals and contaminants. This produces highly purified water, often referred to as a "blank canvas," upon which the brewer can build any desired water profile from scratch.

Implementing an RO system is a strategic decision that functions as a form of quality assurance. It effectively mitigates the significant business risk posed by variable municipal water supplies, which can change their mineral content seasonally or as the municipality switches sources, often without notice. By starting with a consistent, purified base, the brewery ensures that a flagship beer produced in July will be identical to one produced in December, thereby protecting brand reputation and consumer trust. A practical commercial RO setup includes essential pre-filters (sediment and activated carbon) to protect the RO membrane, regular monitoring of Total Dissolved Solids (TDS) to ensure performance, and a routine schedule for cleaning and sanitization.

Step 3: Mineralization with Brewing Salts
Once a purified water base is established (or if the source water is simply being adjusted), specific mineral ions are added in the form of food-grade salts. These additions are precisely calculated to hit the target ppm for the desired beer style. The most common brewing salts are detailed in the table below. These salts are typically added to the Hot Liquor Tank (HLT), which serves as the ideal vessel for treating the entire volume of brewing water (for both the mash and the sparge). This ensures the salts are fully dissolved and homogeneously mixed before coming into contact with the grain.
