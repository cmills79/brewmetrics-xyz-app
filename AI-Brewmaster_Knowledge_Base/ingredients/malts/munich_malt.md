# Malt Name: Munich Malt

## Technical Specifications

Type: Base Malt (Kilned)

Color: 8-10 Lovibond (8-10°L)

Extract Potential: 37-39 PPG

Moisture: 4.5% max

Usage Rate: 10-100% of grain bill

## Flavor Profile

Primary: Toasty, Biscuity, Bread Crust

Secondary: Honey, Light Caramel, Malty Sweetness

Mouthfeel: Fuller body than Pilsner malt

## Production Process

Munich malt is kilned at higher temperatures than Pilsner malt, developing Maillard reaction products that create its characteristic toasty, biscuity flavors. The extended kilning reduces enzymatic power compared to base malts but retains enough diastatic power to convert itself and some adjuncts.

## Brewing Usage

**Primary Uses:**
- Base malt for German styles
- Flavor enhancement in pale ales
- Color and body improvement
- Toasty, malty backbone

**Typical Usage Rates:**
- **As base malt**: 50-100% (German styles)
- **Flavor addition**: 10-30% (American styles)
- **Color enhancement**: 5-15% (pale ales)

## Beer Styles

Traditional for: Märzen, Oktoberfest, Munich Helles, Weissbier, German Lagers

Excellent in: American Amber Ale, Brown Ale, Porter, Vienna Lager

## Substitutions

**Similar Character:**
- Vienna Malt (lighter color, similar flavor)
- Aromatic Malt (more intense flavor)
- Melanoidin Malt (darker, more intense)

**Different Character:**
- Crystal 40L (caramel vs toasty)
- Biscuit Malt (more intense biscuit flavor)
- Victory Malt (nuttier character)

## Diastatic Power

Moderate diastatic power (50-70 Lintner) - sufficient to convert itself and moderate amounts of specialty malts. When used as 100% base malt, ensure proper mashing conditions for complete conversion.

## Storage and Handling

Store in cool, dry place. Munich malt's higher kilning makes it more stable than Pilsner malt. Properly stored, maintains quality for 18-24 months. Check for rancid or stale odors before use.

## Brewing Notes

**Mashing:** Requires full mashing process. Single infusion at 152-154°F works well. Higher protein content may benefit from protein rest at 122°F for 15-20 minutes.

**Water Chemistry:** Works well with moderate mineral content. Calcium levels of 50-150 ppm support enzyme activity.

## Usage Tips

- **German authenticity**: Use 100% Munich for traditional Märzen/Oktoberfest
- **American styles**: 20-40% adds complexity without overwhelming hops
- **Color contribution**: Provides rich golden to amber color
- **Mouthfeel**: Increases body and malt presence
- **Balance**: Excellent for balancing hop-forward beers
