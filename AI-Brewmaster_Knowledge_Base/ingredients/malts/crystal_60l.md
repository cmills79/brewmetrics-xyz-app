# Malt Name: Crystal 60L

## Technical Specifications

Type: Crystal/Caramel Malt

Color: 60 Lovibond (60°L)

Extract Potential: 34-35 PPG

Moisture: 4.0% max

Usage Rate: 5-15% of grain bill

## Flavor Profile

Primary: Caramel, Toffee, Sweet

Secondary: Biscuit, Honey, Light Raisin

Mouthfeel: Adds body and sweetness

## Production Process

Crystal malts are produced by heating wet green malt in a roasting drum. The moisture and heat convert starches to sugars within the grain kernel, then the sugars caramelize as moisture is driven off. This creates the characteristic caramel flavors and unfermentable sugars that add sweetness and body to beer.

## Brewing Usage

**Primary Uses:**
- Color enhancement (golden to amber)
- Caramel and toffee flavors
- Body and mouthfeel improvement
- Residual sweetness balance

**Typical Usage Rates:**
- **Light beers**: 3-8% of grain bill
- **Amber beers**: 8-15% of grain bill
- **Balance hop bitterness**: 5-10% of grain bill

## Beer Styles

Excellent for: American Pale Ale, IPA, Amber Ale, Brown Ale, Porter, ESB

Avoid in: Light lagers, wheat beers, very pale styles where color is critical

## Substitutions

**Similar Color/Flavor:**
- Crystal 55L (slightly lighter)
- Crystal 65L (slightly darker)
- Caramel 60L (same specification, different supplier)

**Different Character:**
- Munich Malt (toasty vs caramel)
- Victory Malt (biscuity vs caramel)
- Special B (darker, raisin flavors)

## Storage and Handling

Store in cool, dry place away from direct sunlight. Properly stored crystal malt maintains quality for 12-18 months. Higher moisture content than base malts makes proper storage more critical. Check for off odors or mold before use.

## Brewing Notes

Crystal 60L requires no mashing - the starches are already converted to sugars during production. Can be steeped like tea in 150-170°F water for 20-30 minutes to extract flavors and sugars. Contributes unfermentable sugars that increase final gravity and body.

## Usage Tips

- **Start conservative**: 5-8% for first use, adjust in future batches
- **Steep properly**: 150-170°F water, don't boil (creates astringency)
- **Balance with hops**: Crystal sweetness pairs well with hop bitterness
- **Consider water**: Hard water can enhance caramel flavors
- **Crush fresh**: Pre-crushed crystal malt loses flavor faster than base malts
