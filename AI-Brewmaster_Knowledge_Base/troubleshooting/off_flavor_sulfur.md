Common Descriptors:

Aroma/Flavor: Rotten eggs, burnt matches, sulfuric.

Diagnostic Information
Typical Causes:

Yeast Metabolism Byproduct: Produced naturally during the synthesis of sulfur-containing amino acids.

Yeast Strain Dependent: Some strains naturally produce more sulfur than others.

Wort Composition: The nutrient profile of the wort can influence sulfur production.

Corrective and Preventative Actions
Solutions for a Batch in Progress:

Age the Beer Longer: Allows yeast to consume the sulfur compounds or for them to naturally dissipate.

Long-Term Prevention:

Ensure Yeast Health: Use healthy yeast with adequate nutrients and a proper fermentation temperature.

Select Yeast Strain Carefully: Choose a yeast strain known for producing fewer sulfur compounds.
