# Poor Hop Aroma

## Problem Description

Lack of expected hop aroma or presence of stale, grassy, or vegetal hop character.

## Common in Styles

- American IPA
- Hazy IPA
- American Pale Ale
- Hop-forward styles

## Causes

- **Stale hops**: Old or improperly stored hops
- **Insufficient late additions**: Too much bittering, not enough aroma
- **Poor dry hopping**: Wrong timing or temperature
- **Hop degradation**: Exposure to oxygen or heat
- **Boil-off**: Volatile oils lost during extended boil
- **Poor storage**: Hops not kept frozen or vacuum sealed

## Solutions

- **Fresh hops**: Use recently harvested, properly stored hops
- **Increase late additions**: More hops at 5 min, whirlpool, dry hop
- **Proper dry hopping**: 65-70Â°F during active fermentation
- **Hop schedule optimization**: Focus on 0-20 minute additions
- **Reduce oxygen exposure**: Purge with CO2 during transfers
- **Multiple dry hop additions**: Split into 2-3 additions

## Prevention

- **Hop storage**: Vacuum sealed, frozen storage
- **Recipe design**: Balance bittering vs aroma hops
- **Process timing**: Add aroma hops at proper times
- **Quality sourcing**: Buy from reputable suppliers
- **Inventory rotation**: Use oldest hops first
