# Infection Prevention and Control

## Understanding Beer Infections

Beer infections are caused by unwanted microorganisms (bacteria, wild yeast, mold) that compete with brewing yeast and produce off-flavors, off-aromas, and visual defects.

## Common Infection Sources

**Environmental:**
- Airborne contaminants
- Dust and debris
- Pet hair and dander
- Kitchen surfaces

**Equipment:**
- Inadequately cleaned/sanitized equipment
- Scratched plastic surfaces harboring bacteria
- Old tubing and gaskets
- Contaminated cleaning cloths

**Ingredients:**
- Infected yeast cultures
- Contaminated adjuncts
- Poor quality water

## Critical Control Points

**Post-Boil Sanitation:**
Everything that touches cooled wort must be sanitized:
- Fermenter and lid
- Airlock and stopper
- Thermometer
- Hydrometer and test jar
- Siphon/racking equipment
- Bottles and caps

**High-Risk Periods:**
- Cooling wort to pitching temperature
- Taking gravity readings
- Dry hopping additions
- Transferring between vessels
- Packaging

## Sanitization Best Practices

**Star-San (Acid Sanitizer):**
- Mix: 1 oz per 5 gallons water
- Contact time: 30 seconds minimum
- No-rinse when properly diluted
- Effective pH: <3.0
- Foaming is normal and beneficial

**Iodophor:**
- Mix: 12.5 ppm (follow label directions)
- Contact time: 2 minutes minimum
- No-rinse when properly diluted
- Avoid contact with stainless steel

**Potassium Metabisulfite:**
- Mix: 2 oz per gallon water
- Contact time: 10 minutes
- Rinse required
- Effective against bacteria and wild yeast

## Cleaning vs. Sanitizing

**Cleaning (removes soil):**
- PBW (Powdered Brewery Wash)
- Oxiclean Free (unscented)
- Caustic cleaners for protein/organic soils
- Acid cleaners for mineral deposits

**Sanitizing (kills microorganisms):**
- Only effective on clean surfaces
- Must contact all surfaces
- Follow proper dilution ratios
- Respect contact times

## Equipment Maintenance

**Replace Regularly:**
- Plastic tubing (every 6-12 months)
- Rubber gaskets and O-rings
- Scratched plastic fermenters
- Old bottle caps

**Deep Cleaning:**
- Disassemble all equipment
- Soak in cleaning solution
- Scrub with soft brushes
- Inspect for damage/wear

## Environmental Controls

**Fermentation Area:**
- Clean, dust-free environment
- Avoid high-traffic areas
- Control temperature and humidity
- Minimize air movement during transfers

**Storage:**
- Clean, dry storage for equipment
- Protect from dust and pests
- Organize to prevent cross-contamination

## Infection Identification

**Visual Signs:**
- Pellicle (film on surface)
- Unusual colors (pink, green, black)
- Excessive sediment
- Ropiness or sliminess

**Aroma/Flavor:**
- Vinegar (acetic acid)
- Rotten eggs (hydrogen sulfide)
- Barnyard/horse blanket (Brettanomyces)
- Sour without intention
- Medicinal/band-aid (phenolic)

## Response to Suspected Infection

**Immediate Actions:**
1. Isolate infected batch
2. Do not cross-contaminate other batches
3. Document symptoms and timeline
4. Consider salvage options

**Salvage Possibilities:**
- Mild infections: Extended conditioning
- Sour infections: Embrace as sour beer
- Surface infections: Careful racking below pellicle
- Severe infections: Discard for safety

## Prevention Checklist

**Pre-Brew:**
- [ ] Clean and sanitize all equipment
- [ ] Prepare sanitizer solution
- [ ] Check equipment for damage
- [ ] Organize workspace

**During Brew:**
- [ ] Maintain sanitation post-boil
- [ ] Minimize exposure time
- [ ] Use proper techniques
- [ ] Keep sanitizer handy

**Post-Brew:**
- [ ] Clean equipment immediately
- [ ] Store properly
- [ ] Monitor fermentation
- [ ] Document any issues

## Advanced Techniques

**Sterile Technique:**
- Flame sterilization for small items
- Alcohol wipes for surfaces
- Laminar flow hoods (advanced)
- Positive pressure environments

**Quality Control:**
- Microscopic examination
- Plating on selective media
- pH monitoring
- Sensory evaluation panels
