# Oxidation

## Problem Description
Stale, cardboard, papery, or sherry-like flavors that develop from oxygen exposure during or after brewing.

## Common in Styles
- Light-colored beers (most noticeable)
- Low-hop beers
- Aged beers
- Any style (process fault)

## Causes
- **Hot-side aeration**: Splashing hot wort during transfer
- **Cold-side oxidation**: Oxygen exposure during fermentation/packaging
- **Poor packaging**: Air in bottles or kegs
- **Extended storage**: Long-term exposure to residual oxygen
- **Equipment design**: Poor transfer systems
- **Temperature abuse**: Heat accelerates oxidation reactions

## Solutions
- **Gentle transfers**: Avoid splashing, use closed transfers
- **CO2 purging**: Purge all vessels and lines with CO2
- **Proper packaging**: Minimize headspace, use oxygen-absorbing caps
- **Fresh consumption**: Drink beer fresh, especially hoppy styles
- **Equipment upgrade**: Invest in closed transfer systems
- **Temperature control**: Store beer cold to slow oxidation

## Prevention
- **Process design**: Minimize oxygen exposure throughout brewing
- **CO2 systems**: Proper CO2 handling and purging procedures
- **Equipment maintenance**: Check seals, gaskets, and fittings
- **Packaging protocol**: Consistent low-oxygen packaging
- **Storage conditions**: Cool, dark storage environments
