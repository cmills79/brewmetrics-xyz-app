# Troubleshooting Guide: Diacetyl

Off-Flavor Name: Diacetyl
Chemical Compound: 2,3-butanedione

Common Descriptors:

Aroma: Buttery, butterscotch, movie theater popcorn butter.

Mouthfeel: Can impart a slick, slippery feeling on the palate.

Diagnostic Information
Typical Causes:
Diacetyl is a natural byproduct of fermentation. The primary issue arises when yeast does not have enough time or is not healthy enough to reabsorb and reduce it into flavorless compounds.

Premature Separation of Yeast: Removing the beer from the yeast too early (e.g., crashing or transferring prematurely) before the diacetyl reduction phase is complete.

Unhealthy Yeast: Under-pitching, lack of oxygen at the start of fermentation, or insufficient nutrients can lead to weak yeast that cannot finish the job.

Low Fermentation Temperature: Fermenting too cold can make yeast sluggish, slowing down the diacetyl reduction process significantly.

Certain Yeast Strains: Some yeast strains, particularly certain English and Czech lager strains, are known to be high producers of diacetyl.

Bacterial Contamination: Pediococcus and Lactobacillus bacteria can produce high levels of diacetyl, often accompanied by souring. This is a sign of a sanitation issue.

Corrective and Preventative Actions
Solutions for a Batch in Progress:

Perform a Diacetyl Rest: The most effective solution. Raise the temperature of the fermenting beer to 68-72°F (20-22°C) for 2-3 days after primary fermentation is complete (i.e., when the gravity is stable). This encourages the yeast to become more active and reabsorb the diacetyl.

Rouse the Yeast: Gently swirl the fermenter to get some yeast back into suspension, increasing its contact with the beer. Be careful not to introduce oxygen at this stage.

Long-Term Prevention:

Ensure a Healthy Fermentation: Pitch the correct amount of healthy, vital yeast and provide adequate aeration/oxygenation at the start of fermentation.

Control Fermentation Temperature: Ferment within the yeast strain's recommended temperature range. If you must ferment cool (e.g., for lagers), always incorporate a diacetyl rest at the end of fermentation before lagering.

Yeast Strain Selection: Be aware of the characteristics of your chosen yeast strain. If using a high diacetyl producer, plan for a diacetyl rest from the beginning.

Impeccable Sanitation: Maintain rigorous cleaning and sanitation practices to prevent bacterial contamination.
