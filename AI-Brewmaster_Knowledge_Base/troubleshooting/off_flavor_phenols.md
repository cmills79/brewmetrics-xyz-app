# Troubleshooting Guide: Phenols (Off-Flavor)

Off-Flavor Name: Phenols (POF - Phenolic Off-Flavor)
Common Descriptors:

Aroma/Flavor: Medicinal, band-aid, plastic, smoke, astringent. (Note: Clove and spicy phenols can be desirable in some styles like Hefeweizens).

Diagnostic Information
Typical Causes:

Contaminated Water: Chlorine in brewing water can react to form undesirable chlorophenols.

Wild Yeast/Bacteria: Contamination from wild Brettanomyces or other spoilage bacteria is a common source.

Improper Sanitation: Poorly cleaned equipment can harbor phenolic-producing microbes.

Corrective and Preventative Actions
Solutions for a Batch in Progress:

Unfortunately, undesirable phenolic off-flavors are very difficult to remove once present. The focus is entirely on prevention.

Long-Term Prevention:

Use Chlorine-Free Water: Filter brewing water or treat it to remove chlorine.

Implement Rigorous Sanitation: Ensure all equipment is thoroughly cleaned and sanitized to prevent contamination.

Ensure Yeast Health: Pitch healthy yeast at the correct temperature for the strain.
