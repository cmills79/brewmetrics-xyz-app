# Poor Head Retention

## Problem Description

Foam dissipates quickly after pouring, leaving little to no head on the beer.

## Common in Styles

- German Pilsner
- Light lagers
- Wheat beers
- High-alcohol beers

## Causes

- **Low protein content**: Insufficient foam-positive proteins
- **Lipids/oils**: Contamination from grains, hops, or equipment
- **Detergent residue**: Cleaning chemicals on glassware
- **Over-attenuation**: Excessive yeast activity
- **Poor carbonation**: Insufficient CO2 levels
- **Adjunct use**: High rice/corn reduces foam proteins

## Solutions

- **Add wheat/oats**: 5-10% for foam-positive proteins
- **Protein rest**: 122Â°F for 15-20 minutes
- **Reduce lipids**: Proper grain storage, fresh ingredients
- **Equipment cleaning**: Thorough rinse after cleaning
- **Carbonation adjustment**: Increase CO2 to style appropriate levels
- **Foam enhancers**: Small amount of carapils/dextrin malt

## Prevention

- **Recipe formulation**: Include foam-positive ingredients
- **Sanitation protocol**: Proper cleaning and rinsing procedures
- **Ingredient quality**: Fresh grains, proper storage
- **Process control**: Avoid excessive oxidation
- **Glassware**: Beer-clean glasses for service
