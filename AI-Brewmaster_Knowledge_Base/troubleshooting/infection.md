# Bacterial/Wild Yeast Infection

## Problem Description
Off-flavors from unwanted microorganisms including sour, funky, medicinal, or barnyard characteristics.

## Common in Styles
- Any style (process fault)
- Light beers (most noticeable)
- Low-alcohol beers
- Unhopped or lightly hopped beers

## Causes
- **Poor sanitation**: Inadequate cleaning and sanitizing
- **Equipment contamination**: Biofilms in hard-to-clean areas
- **Wild yeast**: Airborne contamination during transfer
- **Bacterial infection**: Lactobacillus, Pediococcus, Acetobacter
- **Cross-contamination**: Mixed clean/sour equipment use
- **Environmental factors**: Contaminated air or surfaces

## Solutions
- **Immediate isolation**: Separate infected batches immediately
- **Deep cleaning**: Disassemble and thoroughly clean all equipment
- **Acid sanitizing**: Use acid-based sanitizers for biofilm removal
- **Equipment replacement**: Replace porous or damaged components
- **Process review**: Identify contamination source
- **Dump if severe**: Some infections cannot be salvaged

## Prevention
- **Rigorous sanitation**: Consistent cleaning and sanitizing protocols
- **Equipment maintenance**: Regular deep cleaning and inspection
- **Separate equipment**: Dedicated equipment for sour/wild beers
- **Environmental control**: Clean brewing environment
- **Quality ingredients**: Fresh, uncontaminated raw materials
- **Process monitoring**: Regular sensory evaluation during fermentation
