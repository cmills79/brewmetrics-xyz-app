# Troubleshooting Guide: Acetaldehyde

Off-Flavor Name: Acetaldehyde

Common Descriptors:

Aroma/Flavor: Green apples, rotten apples, freshly cut pumpkin rind, "green beer."

Diagnostic Information
Typical Causes:

Insufficient or Unhealthy Yeast: Not enough yeast or weak yeast cannot fully convert acetaldehyde to ethanol.

Low Fermentation Temperatures: Slows down the conversion process.

Post-Fermentation Oxygen Exposure: Oxygen can oxidize ethanol back into acetaldehyde.

Yeast Autolysis: Prolonged contact with dead yeast can release acetaldehyde.

Corrective and Preventative Actions
Solutions for a Batch in Progress:

Perform a Diacetyl Rest: The slightly warmer temperature can also help yeast process acetaldehyde.

Allow More Time: Give the beer more time on healthy yeast to finish the conversion to ethanol.

Long-Term Prevention:

Pitch Correctly: Use high-quality yeast at the correct pitching rates.

Manage Nutrients: Ensure proper zinc levels (0.15-0.5 ppm) to aid the enzyme that converts acetaldehyde.

Minimize Oxygen: Be meticulous about preventing oxygen exposure during and after fermentation.
