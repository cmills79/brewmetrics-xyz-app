# Diacetyl

## Problem Description

Buttery, butterscotch, or movie theater popcorn flavor that's inappropriate for most beer styles.

## Common in Styles

- Light lagers (most noticeable)
- Pilsners
- Clean ale styles
- Any style (process fault)

## Causes

- **Incomplete fermentation**: Yeast not finishing diacetyl cleanup
- **Bacterial infection**: Pediococcus or Lactobacillus contamination
- **Premature cooling**: Dropping temperature before diacetyl rest
- **Weak yeast**: Under-pitching or poor yeast health
- **High fermentation temperature**: Excessive diacetyl production
- **Poor sanitation**: Wild yeast or bacteria introduction

## Solutions

- **Diacetyl rest**: Hold at 65-68Â°F for 2-3 days after fermentation
- **Extended conditioning**: Allow more time for yeast cleanup
- **Yeast health**: Proper pitching rates and nutrition
- **Temperature control**: Gradual temperature reduction
- **Re-pitch yeast**: Add fresh, healthy yeast if needed
- **Sanitation review**: Improve cleaning and sanitizing procedures

## Prevention

- **Proper fermentation**: Adequate yeast pitch and nutrition
- **Temperature management**: Controlled fermentation profile
- **Diacetyl rest**: Standard practice for lagers and clean ales
- **Sanitation protocol**: Rigorous cleaning and sanitizing
- **Yeast management**: Fresh, viable yeast cultures
