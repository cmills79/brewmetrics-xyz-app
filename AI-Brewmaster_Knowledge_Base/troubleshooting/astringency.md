# Astringency

## Problem Description

Dry, puckering sensation similar to over-steeped tea that creates harsh, unpleasant mouthfeel.

## Common in Styles

- All styles (process fault)
- German Pilsner
- Light lagers
- High-adjunct beers

## Causes

- **High mash pH**: Above 5.8 extracts tannins from grain husks
- **Over-sparging**: Excessive or high-temperature sparging
- **Grain crushing**: Over-milled grain with husk damage
- **Water chemistry**: Low alkalinity, high mineral content
- **Boil vigor**: Excessive boiling extracts tannins
- **Hop matter**: Excessive hop particulate in finished beer

## Solutions

- **Lower mash pH**: Target 5.2-5.6 with acid additions
- **Proper sparging**: Stop at 1.010 SG, max 170Â°F
- **Adjust crush**: Coarser crush to preserve husk integrity
- **Water treatment**: Increase alkalinity, reduce minerals
- **Gentle boil**: Maintain rolling boil without excessive vigor
- **Filtration**: Remove hop and protein matter

## Prevention

- **pH monitoring**: Test and adjust mash pH consistently
- **Water analysis**: Know your water and treat appropriately
- **Process control**: Monitor sparge gravity and temperature
- **Equipment maintenance**: Clean and calibrate pH meters
- **Grain handling**: Proper storage and crushing techniques
