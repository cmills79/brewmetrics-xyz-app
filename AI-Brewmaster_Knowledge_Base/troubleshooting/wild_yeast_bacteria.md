# Contamination: Wild Yeast and Bacteria

Contamination, or "infection," refers to the presence of unintentional microorganisms in beer
fermentation. 22 These can significantly degrade beer quality, leading to off-flavors, haze, and
over-attenuation.
Common contaminants include:
● Wild Saccharomyces Yeast: Can cause flavor defects, over-attenuation, and phenolic
or clove-like notes (unless intentionally desired, as in some German wheat beers).22
● Non-Saccharomyces Yeasts:
○ Brettanomyces (Brett): While intentionally used in sour beers, Brett is generally
considered a spoilage organism in clean beers. It produces funky, "sweaty horse
blanket," or phenolic (farmyard, smoked meat) flavors, can metabolize dextrins
leading to over-attenuation and over-carbonation in bottles, and is notoriously
difficult to remove from equipment. 22
○ Other Oxidative Yeasts (e.g., Candida, Pichia): Can cause films, turbidity, and
undesirable flavors.
● Lactic Acid Bacteria (LAB):
○ Lactobacillus (Lacto) and Pediococcus (Pedio): These are common and
problematic contaminants due to their ability to survive in low-oxygen, low-pH,
and hopped environments. 22 They produce lactic acid, leading to sourness, and
Pediococcus can also produce diacetyl.35
● Acetic Acid Bacteria:
○ Acetobacter and Gluconobacter: These bacteria metabolize ethanol into
harsh-tasting acetic acid (vinegar) and require oxygen to do so. They are
common brewery contaminants.22
● Other Spoilage Bacteria: Such as Pectinatus (fatty acids, acetic acids) and
Megasphaera (hydrogen sulfide, rotten egg smell).62
Sources of Contamination: Microorganisms can be introduced at any point where cooled wort
or beer comes into contact with non-sanitized surfaces or the air. 22 Common sources include
raw brewing materials (grain, hops), additives, uncleaned or improperly sanitized vessels, tubes,
and other brewing equipment. 22 Repitching yeast without proper quality control is a significant
risk, as contaminating wild yeast can outcompete the pitching yeast and become dominant in
subsequent fermentations. 36
Prevention Strategies: Preventing contamination is one of the most crucial aspects of
commercial brewing. 22
● Rigorous Sanitation: Thoroughly clean and sanitize all equipment before and after use.
This includes disassembling fittings and purging vessels with CO2 to minimize oxygen
exposure. 22
● Minimize Open Air Exposure: Air is full of microbes; use closed systems for transfers
and minimize time beer is exposed to the atmosphere.22
● Healthy Yeast Management: Pitch active, healthy yeast promptly. Minimize time in the
fermenter to reduce biofilm formation. 22
● Ingredient Sanitation: Sanitize all ingredients that are not heat-pasteurized (besides
yeast).22
● Avoid Risky Processes: Consider avoiding practices like "no-chill" or no-boil recipes,
excessive numbers of transfers, or open fermentation if not specifically designed for wild
cultures. 22
