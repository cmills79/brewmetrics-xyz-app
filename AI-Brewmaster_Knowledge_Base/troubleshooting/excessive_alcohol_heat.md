# Excessive Alcohol Heat

## Problem Description

Hot, burning sensation from alcohol that overwhelms other flavors instead of providing warming character.

## Common in Styles

- Imperial Stout
- Imperial IPA
- Barleywine
- Belgian Strong Ales
- High-gravity beers (>8% ABV)

## Causes

- **Fermentation temperature too high**: Above 72°F for ales
- **Insufficient yeast pitch**: Under-pitching causes stress
- **Poor yeast health**: Old or stressed yeast
- **Rapid fermentation**: Too fast alcohol production
- **Inadequate aging**: Insufficient time for integration
- **Fusel alcohol production**: Higher alcohols from stress

## Solutions

- **Control fermentation temperature**: 64-68°F for high-gravity ales
- **Increase yeast pitch rate**: 1.5-2x normal rate for high gravity
- **Yeast starter**: Build healthy, active yeast population
- **Gradual temperature rise**: Start cool, allow slow rise
- **Extended aging**: 3-6 months minimum for integration
- **Blending**: Mix with lower-alcohol batch if possible

## Prevention

- **Temperature control**: Invest in fermentation cooling
- **Yeast management**: Fresh, healthy yeast with starters
- **Proper nutrition**: Yeast nutrients for high-gravity worts
- **Patience**: Allow adequate conditioning time
- **Recipe balance**: Ensure malt backbone supports alcohol
