# Sensory Analysis and Off-Flavor Identification

## Sensory Evaluation Fundamentals

**The Five Senses in Beer Evaluation:**

1. **Sight**: Color, clarity, foam, carbonation
2. **Smell**: Aroma intensity, character, balance
3. **Taste**: Sweetness, bitterness, sourness, saltiness, umami
4. **Mouthfeel**: Body, carbonation, astringency, warmth
5. **Sound**: Carbonation release, pour characteristics

**Proper Tasting Technique:**

1. Visual inspection in proper glassware
2. Initial aroma assessment
3. Small sip for first impressions
4. Larger sip for full evaluation
5. Retronasal aroma assessment
6. Finish and aftertaste evaluation

## Off-Flavor Identification Guide

- Bacterial contamination
- Excessive oxygen exposure

**Prevention:**

- Healthy yeast pitch rates
- Proper fermentation temperature
- Adequate fermentation time
- Minimize oxygen exposure

### Diacetyl (Butter/Butterscotch)

**Characteristics:**

- Buttery, butterscotch aroma
- Slick mouthfeel
- Threshold: 0.1-0.15 ppm

**Causes:**

- Incomplete yeast cleanup
- Bacterial contamination
- Temperature fluctuations
- Premature cold crashing

**Prevention:**

- Diacetyl rest (2-3°F temperature rise)
- Healthy yeast populations
- Proper fermentation timeline
- Sanitation protocols

### Dimethyl Sulfide (DMS) - Cooked Corn

**Characteristics:**

- Cooked corn, cabbage aroma
- Sweet corn flavor
- Threshold: 30-60 ppb

**Causes:**

- Insufficient boil vigor
- Slow cooling after boil
- Bacterial contamination
- Pilsner malt usage

**Prevention:**

- Vigorous 60+ minute boil
- Rapid cooling post-boil
- Proper sanitation
- Uncovered boil kettle

### Fusel Alcohols (Hot/Solvent)

**Characteristics:**

- Hot, burning sensation
- Solvent-like aroma

**Causes:**

- High fermentation temperatures
- Yeast stress conditions
- High gravity fermentations
- Poor yeast nutrition

**Prevention:**

- Temperature control (65-72°F ales)
- Adequate yeast nutrition
- Proper pitch rates
- Gradual temperature ramping

### Phenolic Off-Flavors

**Characteristics:**

- Medicinal, band-aid aroma
- Smoky, clove-like flavors
- Harsh, astringent finish
- Threshold: 0.5-5 ppm

**Causes:**

- Wild yeast contamination
- Chlorine/chloramine in water
- Over-sparging (hot side)
- Grain husks in boil

**Prevention:**

- Water treatment (carbon filtration)
- Proper sparging technique
- Sanitation protocols
- Grain crush optimization

### Oxidation (Cardboard/Sherry)

**Characteristics:**

- Cardboard, papery aroma
- Sherry-like flavors in strong beers
- Stale, flat character
- Progressive flavor degradation

**Causes:**

- Oxygen exposure during transfer
- Poor packaging techniques
- Extended storage time
- High storage temperatures

**Prevention:**

- Minimize oxygen exposure
- CO2 purging during transfers
- Proper packaging procedures
- Cold storage conditions

### Infection Indicators

**Lactobacillus:**

- Sour, tart flavors

- Funky, earthy character
- Dry, tart finish
- May be desirable in some styles

**Acetobacter:**

- Vinegar-like acidity
- Sharp, harsh sourness
- Solvent character
- Always undesirable
