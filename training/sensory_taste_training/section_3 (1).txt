Part 3: Quality Assessment and Troubleshooting
A key function of the BrewMetrics AI is to help brewers diagnose and correct faults. This requires a systematic framework for evaluation and a deep knowledge base connecting sensory flaws to their root causes.  
Section 3.1: The BJCP Framework for Evaluation
The Beer Judge Certification Program (BJCP) provides a globally recognized standard for beer evaluation, used in homebrew competitions worldwide. Understanding this framework is essential for interpreting and providing structured feedback.  
* Scoring: Beers are judged on a 50-point scale broken down as follows:
   * Aroma: 12 points
   * Appearance: 3 points
   * Flavor: 20 points
   * Mouthfeel: 5 points
   * Overall Impression: 10 points
* Evaluation: Judges provide detailed written feedback for each category, assessing the beer's adherence to a specific style guideline, its technical merit, and its overall drinkability. The goal is not just to score the beer but to provide constructive, diagnostic feedback that helps the brewer improve.  
* Scoresheet: The BJCP scoresheet is a tool that guides the judge through the evaluation process, with sections and checkboxes for various descriptors and faults.  
Section 3.2: A Systematic Guide to Off-Flavor Troubleshooting
Off-flavors are the most direct indicator of a flaw in the brewing process or handling. The ability to identify an off-flavor, understand its chemical origin, and trace it back to a process error is a core skill of an expert brewer and a primary function of the BrewMetrics AI.  
Off-Flavor Descriptor
	Chemical Compound(s)
	Common Causes & Process Failures
	Prevention & Correction
	Acetaldehyde
	Acetaldehyde
	"Green" (immature) beer. Yeast has not finished converting acetaldehyde to ethanol. Caused by packaging too soon, removing beer from yeast prematurely, or severe yeast stress (under-pitching).  
	Patience. Allow fermentation to complete fully and give the beer adequate conditioning time on the yeast. Ensure proper yeast pitching rates.  
	Diacetyl
	2,3-butanedione
	Incomplete "clean-up" by yeast. Caused by crashing temperature too soon, removing beer from yeast too early, or yeast stress. Can also be a sign of Pediococcus contamination.  
	Diacetyl Rest. Raise fermentation temperature by a few degrees for 2-3 days at the end of fermentation to encourage yeast to reabsorb diacetyl. Ensure healthy yeast pitch.  
	DMS (Dimethyl Sulfide)
	Dimethyl Sulfide
	Insufficient boil-off or slow chilling. SMM, a precursor in malt (especially Pilsner), converts to volatile DMS when hot. A weak boil, covered kettle, or slow chilling traps DMS in the wort.  
	Vigorous Boil & Rapid Chilling. Ensure a strong, rolling boil for at least 60-90 minutes with the kettle uncovered. Chill the wort as quickly as possible post-boil.  
	Oxidation
	Trans-2-Nonenal
	Oxygen exposure after fermentation is complete. Caused by splashing during transfers (racking, bottling, kegging) or failing to purge vessels with CO2.  
	Minimize Oxygen Contact. Practice gentle, closed transfers. Purge kegs and bottles with CO2 before filling. This flaw is irreversible.
	Light-Struck (Skunky)
	3-methyl-2-butene-1-thiol (MBT)
	UV light exposure. A photochemical reaction breaks down hop iso-alpha-acids. Occurs rapidly in clear or green glass bottles.  
	Protect from Light. Package beer in brown bottles or opaque cans. Store away from direct sunlight and fluorescent lights.
	Phenolic (Medicinal/Plastic)
	Chlorophenols, other phenols
	Contamination or water chemistry. "Band-Aid" or medicinal flavors are often from chlorophenols (chlorine in water reacting with yeast). Other plastic/smoky notes can come from wild yeast contamination.  
	Water Treatment & Sanitation. Treat brewing water with a Campden tablet or carbon filter to remove chlorine/chloramine. Ensure rigorous sanitation of all cold-side equipment.  
	Solvent / Fusel Alcohol
	Higher Alcohols (e.g., propanol, isoamyl alcohol), Ethyl Acetate
	Fermentation temperature too high. Stressed yeast overproduces these harsh, "hot" tasting alcohols and solventy esters.  
	Temperature Control. Ferment within the yeast strain's recommended temperature range using a fermentation chamber or other cooling method.  
	Astringency
	Tannins/Polyphenols
	Extraction of tannins from grain husks. Caused by over-sparging, sparging with water that is too hot (>170°F) or has too high a pH, or over-milling the grain.  
	Control Mash & Sparge. Do not over-crush grains. Keep sparge water temperature below 170°F and monitor mash pH to keep it in the 5.2-5.6 range.  
	Sour / Acidic (Unintended)
	Lactic Acid, Acetic Acid
	Bacterial contamination. Spoilage from wild Lactobacillus (lactic acid) or Acetobacter (acetic acid/vinegar) due to poor sanitation.  
	Rigorous Sanitation. Ensure all equipment that touches the beer after the boil is thoroughly cleaned and sanitized.
